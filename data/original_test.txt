a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline mike pence a koch favorite mulls run for president the story ticked off items on pence s conservative things to do list while also noting his close ties to the deep pocketed koch brothers as well as other right wing lobbying groups last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers and supported gov pence s tax slashing budget now pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians why would pence ignore the pleas of indiana s chamber of commerce as well as the republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill because there s a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its candidate and this bill was pence s way of shoring up his street cred it is also the reason why republican jeb bush pence s fellow white house hopeful who is viewed as a little light in that category was first to rush in to defend pence and the law one lesson here just because more than of the country now lives in states where same sex marriage is legal does not mean of the country is happy about it backlash aside the fact is pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump the very public debate that now embroils him and arkansas gov asa hutchinson and likely other states considering similar proposals this year is more than enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped pence was i expecting this kind of backlash heavens no for there is no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights which unfortunately will turn numerous americans into single issue voters i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the general election overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy instead it looks like it s going to be dragged down to a replay of pat buchanan s cultural war speech during which he told the republican national convention we stand with george h w bush against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women and later followed with there is a religious war going on in this country it is a cultural war as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself for this war is for the soul of america progressives may enjoy watching pence s temporary fall from grace but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of hopeful sen ted cruz of texas who has indicated a federal ban on same sex marriage is not off the gop table and even if you think neither pence nor bush nor cruz will win the nomination someone has to in light of that listen to conservative former arkansas gov mike huckabee a potential candidate describing conservatives discomfort with same sex marriage it s like asking someone who s jewish to start serving bacon wrapped shrimp in their deli or louisiana gov bobby jindal i certainly will support ted cruz and others that are talking about making a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage or wisconsin gov scott walker who has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions and ben carson said jail turns people gay so there s that remember pence didn t act alone he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials in fact according to the american civil liberties union the indiana rfra religious freedom restoration act is one of introduced in states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment who supports denounces indiana law gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay friendly but the trend on the state level tells a different story perhaps we re witnessing the final gasp of long ago biases or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated former rep barney frank of massachusetts the first member of congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office said he believes republicans want the supreme court to rule in favor of same sex marriage to provide political cover in the gop primary we re winning he told a crowd in chicago recently while promoting his latest book i guess if you look at where the country was on lgbt issues years ago we definitely are that s assuming you are part of the we who believe lgbt people should have the same rights as their heterosexual cisgender counterparts but as the situation in indiana has shown winning should not be mistaken for having won for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so called religious freedom bills snaking through red state legislatures or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop especially with republicans controlling both the house and the senate pence and to a lesser extent jeb bush may be toxic now but america has a short attention span more importantly they are not alone frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls if that holds true in winning is going to feel very strange

as goes walmart so goes the nation everyone from apple ceo tim cook to the head of the ncaa slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers but it was the opposition from walmart the ubiquitous retailer that dots the american landscape that perhaps resonated most deeply providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland walmart s staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about workers well above the federal minimum wage taken together the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals and some prominent republicans are urging the party to take notice former minnesota gov tim pawlenty who famously called on the gop to be the party of sam s club not just the country club told cnn that walmart s actions foreshadow where the republican party will need to move the republican party will have to better stand for ideas on helping the middle class said pawlenty the head of the financial services roundtable a washington lobbying group for the finance industry the party s leaders must be willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs housing public accommodation against gays and lesbians walmart which employs more than people in arkansas emerged victorious on wednesday hours after the company s ceo doug mcmillon called on republican gov asa hutchinson to veto the bill the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed walmart s opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party which the company s political action committee has tended to support in the walmart pac gave around million to republicans versus less than to democrats according to data from the center for responsive politics that gap has grown less pronounced in recent years in the pac spent about million to support republicans and around for democrats it has been a gradual transformation for walmart in the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity two years later the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same sex partners of employees starting in retail experts say walmart s evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base as well as a recognition of the country s increasingly progressive views of gay equality support for same sex marriage is at a new high of according to a recent wall street journal nbc news poll it s easy for someone like a chick fil a to take a really polarizing position said dwight hill a partner at the retail consulting firm mcmillandoolittle but in the world of the largest retailer in the world that s very different hill added same

measures in indiana and arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community s overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality after indiana gov mike pence a republican signed his state s religious freedom bill into law ceos of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the hoosier state the resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions including bill oesterle ceo of the business rating website angie s list and a one time campaign manager for former indiana gov mitch daniels oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in indianapolis in light of the state s passage of the religious freedom act nascar scheduled to hold a race in indianapolis this summer also spoke out against the indiana law what we re seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business said jason rahlan spokesman for the human rights campaign the debate has reached presidential politics national republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination likely gop presidential candidate jeb bush initially backed indiana s religious freedom law and pence but moderated his tone a few days later the former florida governor said wednesday that indiana could have taken a better and more consensus oriented approach by the end of the week indiana will be in the right place bush said a reference to pence s promise this week to fix his state s law in light of the widespread backlash others in the gop field are digging in sen ted cruz of texas the only officially declared republican presidential candidate said wednesday that he had no interest in second guessing pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law i think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda cruz said meanwhile former secretary of state hillary clinton

on may some people gathered in a stadium in china s northwestern xinjiang region but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event instead the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits armed soldiers guarded the exits in the patently unfair open air trial that followed people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed three were sentenced to death the public mass sentencing was part a china s strike hard campaign against unrest in xinjiang a campaign the government claims was launched to combat terrorism and separatism but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world governments using the death penalty in a misguided and often cynical attempt to tackle crime and terrorism today amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide much of it makes for grim reading in pakistan the government lifted a six year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december more than people have been put to death since and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows iran and iraq executed people for terrorism and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee jerk reaction to terrorism other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address or appear to address crime rates jordan ended an eight year moratorium in december putting murder convicts to death with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime in indonesia authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety national emergency six people have already been executed this year a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in up more than on the previous year can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough at amnesty international we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades thankfully most of the world now appears to agree with us the numbers speak for themselves in when the united nations was founded only eight countries had abolished the death penalty today states are abolitionist in law or practice last year we recorded executions in countries down by almost a half from years ago despite the troubling developments we recorded last year there was still much good news to be found the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in compared with the previous year from to this number does not include china where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret the true figure is impossible to determine executions were recorded in only three countries in sub saharan africa equatorial guinea somalia and sudan and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter the americas continued to be execution free apart from the united states those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment with determination i know that we can achieve this goal
marseille france cnn the french prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of germanwings flight insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane marseille prosecutor brice robin told cnn that so far no videos were used in the crash investigation he added a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators robin s comments follow claims by two magazines german daily bild and french paris match of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board germanwings flight as it crashed into the french alps all on board were killed paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site the two publications described the supposed video but did not post it on their websites the publications said that they watched the video which was found by a source close to the investigation one can hear cries of my god in several languages paris match reported metallic banging can also be heard more than three times perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object towards the end after a heavy shake stronger than the others the screaming intensifies then nothing it is a very disturbing scene said julian reichelt editor in chief of bild online an official with france s accident investigation agency the bea said the agency is not aware of any such video lt col jean marc menichini a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site told cnn that the reports were completely wrong and unwarranted cell phones have been collected at the site he said but that they hadn t been exploited yet menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous bois near paris in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand in hand with investigators but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute menichini said asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media menichini answered with a categorical no reichelt told erin burnett outfront that he had watched the video and stood by the report saying bild and paris match are very confident that the clip is real he noted that investigators only revealed they d recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports that is something we did not know before overall we can say many things of the investigation weren t revealed by the investigation at the beginning he said what was mental state of germanwings co pilot german airline lufthansa confirmed tuesday that co pilot andreas lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of germanwings flight which he s accused of deliberately crashing last week in the french alps lubitz told his lufthansa flight training school in that he had a previous episode of severe depression the airline said tuesday email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation lufthansa said included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training the announcement indicates that lufthansa the parent company of germanwings knew of lubitz s battle with depression allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit lufthansa whose ceo carsten spohr previously said lubitz was fit to fly described its statement tuesday as a swift and seamless clarification and said it was sharing the information and documents including training and medical records with public prosecutors spohr traveled to the crash site wednesday where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside he saw the crisis center set up in seyne les alpes laid a wreath in the village of le vernet closer to the crash site where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial menichini told cnn late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching french president francois hollande speaking tuesday said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week sooner than authorities had previously suggested in the meantime the recovery of the victims personal belongings will start wednesday menichini said among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the passengers and six crew on board check out the latest from our correspondents the details about lubitz s correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz s possible motive for downing the jet a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate had passed all his examinations and held all the licenses required earlier a spokesman for the prosecutor s office in dusseldorf christoph kumpa said medical records reveal lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot s license kumpa emphasized there s no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot s license a european government official briefed on the investigation told cnn on tuesday while flying was a big part of his life the source said it s only one theory being considered another source a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems lubitz s girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues the european government official said but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles there s more to the story said brian russell a forensic psychologist psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren t going to keep doing their job and they re upset about that and so they re suicidal he said but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on other people who had nothing to do with the person s problems germanwings crash compensation what we know who was the captain of germanwings flight cnn s margot haddad reported

the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne switzerland on thursday that limits iran s nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon expect pushback anyway if the recent past is any harbinger just last month in an attempt to head off such an agreement house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress and senators sent a letter to the iranian leadership warning them away from a deal the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions let us address some of these the most misleading assertion despite universal rejection by experts is that the negotiations objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in iran that is the position of netanyahu and his acolytes in the u s congress but that is not and never was the objective if it had been there would have been no iranian team at the negotiating table rather the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal it would reduce iran s low enriched uranium stockpile cut by two thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime another dubious assumption of opponents is that the iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program despite sharp accusations by some in the united states and its allies iran denies having such a program and u s intelligence contends that iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon iran s continued cooperation with international atomic energy agency inspections is further evidence on this point and we ll know even more about iran s program in the coming months and years because of the deal in fact the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the iranians what s more the rhetoric of some members of congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the united states and iran i e the senators letter warning that a deal might be killed by congress or a future president this of course is not the case the talks were between iran and the five permanent members of the u n security council united states united kingdom france china and russia plus germany dubbed the p while the united states has played a leading role in the effort it negotiated the terms alongside its partners if the agreement reached by the p is rejected by congress it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on iran and threaten nato cohesion in other areas another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause after which iran will be free to do as it pleases again this is not the case some of the restrictions on iran s nuclear activities such as uranium enrichment will be eased or eliminated over time as long as years but most importantly the framework agreement includes iran s ratification of the additional protocol which allows iaea inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared this provision will be permanent it does not sunset thus going forward if iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons grade levels monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the u n security council many in congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the senate to advise and consent but the issue is not suited for a treaty treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories for example the new start treaty limits russia and the united states to deployed strategic warheads but any agreement with iran will not be so balanced the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on iran the p are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal finally some insist that any agreement must address iranian missile programs human rights violations or support for hamas or hezbollah as important as these issues are and they must indeed be addressed they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal preventing a nuclear iran to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies including israel those judgments should be fact based not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions
los angeles cnn it s more than just one state s internal problem the historic california drought hurts the rest of the union too that s because california is a breadbasket to the nation growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two thirds of its fruits and nuts here s why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted gov jerry brown to announce a mandatory cutback in water consumption in all cities in one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the california drought he was often right according to statistics gathered by timothy richards agribusiness professor at arizona state university prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table berries rose in price by about cents per clamshell to broccoli by cents per pound to grapes by cents a pound to melons by cents a pound to packaged salad by cents a bag to peppers by cents a pound to though fruits and vegetable prices fell in february overall prices are expected to rise this year because of inflation u s department of agriculture economist annemarie kuhns said fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between and and vegetables between and close to historical average increases kuhns said whether the california drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown thanks to a strong dollar the greenback s strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of west coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation kuhns said moreover the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from california to the other states she said what economists don t know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices she said the drought in california does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter kuhns said we are not sure what the exact impact will be the reality is there s a major drought throughout the west and southwest while not as bad as california texas and oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought the two worst categories in several parts of their states the u s drought monitor said this week overall the western drought affects more than million people the monitor says as a result consumers paid a whopping extra for beef and veal in the usda reports straining under a drought that began in ranchers in texas and oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures paid more for feed and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle so the cattlemen began culling their herds kuhns said this year s beef and veal prices should rise only by at most still higher than the historical average the feds project but beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought there s other areas being affected kuhns said it s called the golden state for the gold rush of yore but let s face it the rest of the nation flocks to california for vacation because of another golden reason its year round sunshine so the next time you take a holiday in california you ll find a few changes around here thanks to the drought like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant you won t find water waiting for you on the table eateries now can only serve water to customers on request the state water resources control board declared in march under expanded emergency regulations tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily these requests are mandatory under the new regulations and they ll see fewer homes running decorative fountains because much of the snowpack in the sierra nevada has alarmingly disappeared many ski resorts shut down early this year including at lake tahoe and some are now building zip lines mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming the sacramento bee reported if the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are state water board chair felicia marcus said in march but what about those yummy california wines you ask guess what they re only getting better because of the drought yes you read that right the wine grape harvest was third in a string of great vintages this decade the wine institute says california vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south napa in late august just as crush was getting underway the institute said in a statement last year a mild winter and spring caused early bud break although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years wine grapes use relatively low water said institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi yes drought years tend to produce terrific quality she added with the record high california wine grape harvests in and there is a good supply of california wine that may be the only thing to toast about this drought

since iran s islamic revolution in women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men but the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events a plan to allow women and families to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year deputy sports minister abdolhamid ahmadi said saturday according to state run media but it isn t clear exactly which games women will be able to attend according to the state run press tv ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events the rules won t change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and families are not interested in attending them press tv cited him as saying iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men s sports events after the revolution deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un islamic during the ensuing decades the crowds at soccer games iran s most popular sport have been all male iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate president mohammad khatami but the ban was reinstated in after the more hard line mahmoud ahmadinejad came to power the iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions fifa president sepp blatter called on iran last month to end its intolerable ban on women attending soccer matches saying the situation cannot continue iran had been in the running to host the edition of soccer s asian cup but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran s chances of securing the event the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction during the match against iraq activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami a british iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game saying she was taken into custody for anti iran activities the news agency reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the court of appeal cnn s annie ramos contributed to this report
just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day online activity blogs youtube channels even social media platforms like facebook and twitter have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence though that in itself is liberating it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online it is not unique to asia but it might seem more pronounced if you live there going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard but it still brings resistance some of it legal some of it deadly let s look at the legal angle first amos yee the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in singapore drew international attention for his anti lee kuan yew harangue but jailing critics is not usually the government s first choice in singapore it is part of lee kuan yew s legacy that the government s use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases usually carrying heavy financial penalties is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices his father has reportedly apologized for his son s behavior but the younger yee could face up to three years in jail yee is not unique another dissident blogger in singapore roy ngerng continues to suffer financial and legal pressure including the loss of his job because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city state s prime minister lee hsien loong of corruption ngerng s concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the central provident fund the government s compulsory pension program yee and ngerng are two of many the committee to protect journalists file on singapore going back to has a long string of similar cases some against politicians others against citizens simply frustrated with their government but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire on monday in malaysia with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site s march report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors known as the conference of rulers had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud or punishments meted out under islamic law in deeply muslim malaysia questions of islamic faith are a third rail issue as is revealing government decisions before they are announced by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is china where a majority of the people behind bars at the end of were bloggers most of them uighur or tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism but in second place in asia is vietnam where cpj s most recent prison census showed vietnam holding reporters behind bars as of december add one more in late december nguyen dinh ngoc a prominent blogger who was arrested for law violating after police searched his home in southern ho chi minh city on december and two more in january nguyen quang lap and hong le tho arrested on anti state charges of abusing democratic freedoms and you can see the pattern because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in vietnam their cases dating back to and both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage the list could go on but the reality is that as cpj wrote in across asia governments have curtailed internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices including prohibitive laws heightened surveillance and censorship and threats of imprisonment on various national security related offenses that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in asia and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon jailing journalists is one thing but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another since of journalists killed have died for their work online because our start date really precedes the full advent of the internet that proportion can be expected to grow while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers bangladesh has recently become the exception on monday washiqur rahman babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in bangladesh in the past five weeks blogger avijit roy and his wife rafida ahmed bonna were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting dhaka roy a u s citizen of bangladeshi origin was killed and his wife was critically injured both rahman and roy had written critically on islamic matters the blogger death toll gets higher in bangladesh if you go back a year or two and religious beliefs are always involved and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity in january blogger asif mohiuddin who wrote critical commentary on religion islamist groups free speech and human rights barely survived after he was stabbed by islamists in february blogger ahmed rajib haider who had written about islamic fundamentalism and islamist groups was hacked to death by members of an islamist militant group

washington cnn israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu criticized the deal six world powers struck to thwart iran s nuclear ambitions saying he sees better options than this bad deal or war i think there s a third alternative and that is standing firm ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal netanyahu told cnn s jim acosta sunday on state of the union his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from to active centrifuges limiting its highly enriched uranium and increasing inspections president barack obama endorsed the deal saying it was better than the alternatives but gop contenders for the party s presidential nomination lambasted it saying it gave iran too much flexibility on sunday the sparring continued one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to contain himself and a top republican said almost any of obama s successors as president could do better netanyahu s most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he d made in a march trip to washington when he addressed a joint session of congress fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it s implemented it does not roll back iran s nuclear program it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place not a single centrifuge is destroyed not a single nuclear facility is shut down including the underground facilities that they built illicitly thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning enriching uranium netanyahu said sunday that s a very bad deal netanyahu said iran is a country of congenital cheating and that it can t be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal which lasts years with some provisions extending well beyond that he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful netanyahu said democratic sen dianne feinstein of california meanwhile said she wishes netanyahu would contain himself the top ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal from iran and the united states as well as russia china britain france and germany are on the cusp of something that can be workable it s a framework it has to be wrapped into a final agreement there still can be some changes feinstein said but i don t think it s helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic which is downhill a downhill dynamic in this part of the world energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs face the nation on sunday saying it would extend from two months to one year the breakout time period the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb he said it also allows for the almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb he said sen lindsey graham r south carolina said on face the nation that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a new crack at it with a new president that doesn t have the baggage of obama and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides with the exception of sen rand paul of kentucky who s called for a less active u s role overseas would likely strike a better deal hillary clinton would do better i think everybody on our side except maybe rand paul could do better graham said

it s the kind of thing you see in movies like robert redford s role in all is lost or ang lee s life of pi but in real life it s hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days weeks if not months and somehow living to talk about it miracles do happen though and not just in hollywood we re not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the u s coast guard much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they d brought aboard if any in order to survive they can t bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city town or boat but instead must rely on ingenuity resourcefulness and luck it s hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly with a sailor dying at sea except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues such happy endings do occur given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts below are a few recent examples louis jordan says that he set off on his foot sailboat from south carolina in late january he headed into the gulf stream looking for a good spot to catch fish and then everything his boat his life turned upside down rescued man says he is utterly thankful not only did his boat capsize but its mast broke jordan said and so too did his shoulder he bought time by rationing water then collecting fresh water in a bucket as to food jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail but jordan said it took so long it moved so slowly his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a german flagged container ship the houston express spotted jordan about miles off the north carolina coast on thursday after their reunion his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads i thought i lost you jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon viejo a port on mexico s pacific coast in late the exact date is up for debate he says he set off in december locals say it was november but what s not in doubt is that after he left he disappeared until january that s when alvarenga interacted with humans once again thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the marshall islands castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in pacific what was supposed to be a one day trip he says turned into an arduous odyssey across the pacific ocean one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course then a storm hit causing their boat which was about three people long and one wide to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems four weeks in alvarenga said his partner year old ezequiel cordova according to the boat s owner died because he refused to eat raw birds the days weeks and months ran together after that alvarenga says he drank rainwater and when there wasn t any available his own urine he ate sea turtles then after or months adrift he and his small heavily damaged boat arrived on the ebon atoll about a hour boat ride from the marshall islands capital of majuro the atoll has one phone line no internet service and a few residents two of whom alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods the el salvador native told cnn that his faith in god helped him survive i thought i am going to get out he said get out get out get out some in their late s might relax in their retirement reining it in a few notches as life slows down and if you live in hawaii there s even more reason to take it easy the thing is ron ingraham isn t one of those people he s a fisherman the sea is both his life and livelihood his son zakary told cnn and he s tough with his son jokingly comparing him to rambo still even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what ron ingraham went through after setting off around last thanksgiving solo from the hawaiian island of molokai son vindicated as father rescued after days at sea after bad weather hit ron ingraham told cnn affiliate khnl kgmb that his foot sailboat went backwards all night long at one point a huge wave struck pushing his mast into the water and him as well the year old used a rope to pull himself back in but his boat couldn t be rescued so easily leaving him at the mercy of the current a distress call went out prompting a search that would cover square miles when a coast guard official told him the search was being called off december zakary ingraham responded i don t feel like he s dead i don t feel it he was right twelve days after that first distress call ron ingraham was picked up about miles kilometers south of honolulu weak hungry and dehydrated and most importantly alive the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him in february two friends asked year old adrian vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition he said yes and the three set off from the panama town of san carlos on a small boat vasquez s mother nilsa de la cruz recalled things started out well by all accounts the three caught plenty of fish then their boat s engine died without warning and with no tools and scant navigational experience the trio didn t know what to do according to vasquez s mother mother calls panama teen s return a miracle vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat the fifty cents further and further from the coast and into the pacific ocean somewhere along the way his two companions died it s not clear exactly how with ecuadorian rear adm freddy garcia calle saying vasquez threw their bodies into the sea because they had become badly decomposed some days after and nearly miles away from where the journey began fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the galapagos islands the ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor who d lost pounds and showed severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition according to calle he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal for us this is an opportunity to get closer as a family his mother said by phone to be more understanding and loving sometimes one doesn t have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled sometimes people don t have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end for proof look no further than

the terrorist group al shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group s activities and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast somalia based al shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya the most well known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in cross border raids into kenya by the group however date back to al shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia s internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al shabaab and other militants for several years al shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al qaeda and isis also known as islamic state but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support its origins lie in al ittihad al islami unity of islam one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in these disparate groups fought each other and a u n peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later al shabaab literally the youth split from unity of islam in and merged with another radical islamist group the so called islamic courts union as their alliance obtained control of somalia s capital mogadishu in ethiopia the only majority christian country in the region took military action against the group the offensive weakened al shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia but it failed to defeat it to the contrary ethiopia s invasion and occupation of parts of somalia although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union enabled al shabaab to partially re invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign christian invasion initially the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces but soon began to expand its activities against the somali government as well the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in soon after this cross border raids in kenya began predominantly targeting christians there increasing its links with al qaeda al shabaab declared its full allegiance in and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis much will depend on how the relationships between al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap a long time ally of al shabaab based in yemen and isis develop the key point is that al shabaab s attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden variety fundamentalist terrorism clearly the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems from economic development challenges to environmental degradation from organized crime to inter tribal and inter communal violence from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance these entrenched inequalities help al shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious tribal and nationalist identities ultimately though this all comes down to a struggle for control over people over territory and over resources as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political economic and social participation in their societies which are dominated by primarily self interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests it is important to counter al shabaab directly including by military means but there won t be any lasting solution to the wider region s security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al shabaab as garissa shows these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit copyright the conversation some rights reserved
easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith but it s surrounded by interesting quirks it celebrates the completion of christ s mission of salvation in the crucifixion and resurrection by dying on good friday christ atoned for the sins of others by rising from the grave on sunday christ conquered death simple enough and reason for christians to celebrate but like christmas with its tree ornaments and santa claus easter has picked up its peripheral trappings the bunny and colorful eggs unlike christmas it doesn t fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events and that blood moon we just had is it pure coincidence that it fell around easter no here s a journey from the vatican to the holy land around the moon and the earth s tilting axis to germany and the united states to try to explain the complex holiday called easter and you ll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool aid let s start at the vatican at the vatican holy week began with palm sunday last week and culminated in easter sunday mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of christ s mortal life jesus rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem on palm sunday where crowds celebrated him as the messiah and laid down palm branches in his path but the crowd and the romans turned on him in the course of the week according to the bible leading to his crucifixion and resurrection rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray st peter s square on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by pope francis afterward the pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his urbi et orbi address francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe from nigeria to south sudan iraq to ukraine he expressed hope that violence would end francis also doesn t put on airs this week he washed the feet of believers repeating the biblical account of a woman a sinner washing jesus feet and anointing them with oil let s move on to old jerusalem the birthplace of easter the church of the holy sepulcher in old jerusalem unifies the spot where christ was crucified calvary with his tomb or sepulcher on sunday catholics and armenian christians celebrated the resurrection there in the morning the latin patriarch the archbishop of jerusalem entered the basilica then mass was held followed by a procession but a large group of indigenous christians didn t join them it s not quite easter yet in the holy land for eastern orthodox christians they ll be celebrating a week from now because they determine easter s date by a different calendar than western christians the julian calendar which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of easter sunday a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday right between good friday and easter sunday and during passover just a coincidence not completely because the dates for both passover the jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in egypt and easter are determined by moon phases according to timeanddate com easter s timing is related to passover because jesus was crucified around then according to the bible many jewish holidays including passover fall on full moon which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse the event that turns the moon a blood red color since the timing of moon phases doesn t jibe with earth s orbit which is how we determine the length of a year now passover s exact date moves around and so does easter s when christian bishops first convened at the council of nicaea in the year they made a rule to determine the date of easter so as to fairly reliably pin it to passover it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox that s the day in march when earth s axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length but if the full moon fell on sunday easter would be pushed down a week confusing it got worse when the west moved from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar orthodox christians stayed put resulting in usually two separate dates for easter in the world council of churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences it didn t catch on but some odd easter trappings that popped up after the middle ages very much have the eggs and the bunny the bunny is an egg laying pagan that worships the moon that s one notion of its origins but probably not the actual one german immigrants appear to have brought it to north america in the s german historians are not clear on its beginnings but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in professor of medicine georg franck von frankenau described in his paper de ovis paschalibus or on easter eggs a custom in the alsace region involving a bunny and eggs according to german public television some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree but von frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose leading to a number of theories in germany one common idea during lent people had to abstain from eating eggs but hens kept on laying them so farmers boiled and preserved them by the time easter rolled around they were practically swimming in them they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit play hide and seek with them color them give them as gifts parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the easter eggs came from if you re coloring eggs this year here s an interesting tip instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar use kool aid youtube science geek grant thompson suggests and it appears to work just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye but be careful it stains everything else like clothes and upholstery thompson warns that s why your tongue changes colors when you drink it happy easter happy passover
after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered on its website the ncaa prominently states it s our commitment and our responsibility to give young people opportunities to learn play and succeed and later it says that in the collegiate model of sports the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first athletes second but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes the lawsuit claimed the students didn t get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history in its response the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student athletes at its member institutions even with pages of online information about academic standards and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student athletes and the ncaa does not have direct day to day operational control over member institutions like unc it s nonsense it s double talk said gerald gurney a former athletic academic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport if you look at their basic core principles it s all about academics the experience the integration of academics and the education of the student is paramount gurney said they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement which read in part the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaa s role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist student athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field this case is troubling for a number of reasons not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every student athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them said donald remy ncaa chief legal officer in its response to the lawsuit it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who over years were funneled into classes that never met where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports mary willingham the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they re academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about she says is a sham why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can t legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway it makes no sense said willingham who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called cheated if they can t legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that then why certify students semester after semester to play it s lost its meaning for me the ncaa s claim that it s hands off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years not just in the rhetoric on its website but in speeches by its president mark emmert and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes for example before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed o bannon suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism insisting that college athletes are paid with an education that s the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by big time sports attorney jeffrey kessler seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value in response the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education consistent with its commitment to amateurism member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws attorney michael hausfeld who represented both o bannon and now the unc athletes said this this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaa s shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that what we live for is the education of our athletes but the ncaa s record tells a far different story but rick burton professor of sport management at syracuse university said it s not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country i understand i think where the ncaa is coming from we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university he said it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina and there s no logic to that he said the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa unc which was also sued has admitted to the fraud but also asked for a judge to throw out the case saying the athletes waited too long seven years to sue and the educational malpractice theory doesn t apply unc claims it is protected by state law this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal the ncaa which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from dangerous and exploitive athletic practices now says it does not enforce health and safety rules in fact in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in the ncaa wrote the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect student athletes a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions far behind even the nfl ramogi huma president of the national college players association and a leading thorn in the ncaa s side for decades said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all there s nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it doesn t protect players if it doesn t play a role in the education of college athletics it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist and why does it have a tax exemption
a connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being according to her attorney josh michtom a connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision wednesday denying a motion to let the teen identified in court documents as cassandra c go home the judge also denied a motion for visitation the year old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments on march michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother s home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness michtom and attorney michael taylor who represents cassandra s mother jackie fortin released a written statement after receiving the judge s decision wednesday we are disappointed in this ruling not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence we re conferring with our clients now about next steps including whether to take another appeal cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy without it doctors said at the time she was likely to die within two years she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days according to court documents when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body in december a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families at that time she was admitted to connecticut children s medical center in hartford and has remained there since then doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra s chest to administer chemotherapy medications which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned according to michtom she s seen in her case the side effects weren t bad and she s been well treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment he said her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions joette katz the commissioner of the department of children and families told cnn in march the agency is very pleased with cassandra s progress toward a complete recovery we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life the agency has denied cnn s request to speak with cassandra or her physicians according to michtom the department of children and families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn t he said the department sees cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with michtom and taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once cassandra completes her last round of chemo expected around the end of april and that she ll be allowed to return home so for now cassandra is said to spend her days reading watching tv and drawing the hospital is effectively jail michtom said

the united states has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion especially in indiana where its new religious freedom restoration act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people such state laws have been growing ever since the u s religious freedom restoration act became law in designed to prohibit the federal government from substantially burdening a person s exercise of religion so far states have some version of the religious liberty law and the legal controversies have grown too nonetheless claims under those state rfras are exceedingly rare and victories involved mostly religious minorities not christian denominations experts say there is reason to doubt whether these state level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers wrote wayne state university law professor christopher lund in a analysis when there were only states with such laws here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an irs accountant to a tea from the amazon he was a native american with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes but not in the eyes of the feds in robert soto and michael russell attended an american indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers in violation of the federal eagle protection act which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground soto a lipan apache asserted he was participating in an indian religious ceremony the feathers are sacred to native americans but a federal fish and wildlife service agent found his tribe wasn t federally recognized and soto surrendered his feathers russell who is married to soto s sister isn t american indian and agreed to pay a fine according to court papers and the america bar association journal soto however petitioned the federal interior department to return his feathers the feds said no because he wasn t from a recognized tribe soto and russell sued the federal government but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government rejecting the two men s first amendment assertions and their claims under the federal religious freedom restoration act the same statute that indiana legislators used in developing their new state law but last august the th u s circuit court of appeals reversed the trial court s decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government s action would violate the federal rfra on march the federal government returned the eagle feathers to soto but the legal war isn t over the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute soto and his congregants so soto is seeking a preliminary injunction claiming the feds are violating the federal rfra said luke goodrich soto s attorney who s with the becket fund for religious liberty a tea used by a brazilian faith is to them like wine used by catholics at communion but u s agents considered the brew an illegal drug the religious organization o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca made from two plants native to the amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine a hallucinogen in violation of the controlled substances act the religion is a christian spiritist faith that originated in brazil and includes amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions about members of the church live in the united states and use the tea in a sacred communion in may u s customs agents entered the church headquarters in santa fe new mexico and seized all of its hoasca the church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for american indians to use another illegal drug peyote in their religious ceremonies in fact the federal rfra was designed partly to protect the native americans use of peyote said cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin they were a legitimate religion and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion and congress wanted to make sure it was protected toobin said of peyote and the law the uniao do vegetal which means the union of the plants cited that federal law in suing the federal government the government has never explained why it has accommodated the native american church s use of peyote which contains mescaline also a controlled substance but cannot accommodate the udv s use of hoasca the church said in a statement the u s supreme court ruled in the church s favor saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use the peyote exception also fatally undermines the government s broader contention that the controlled substances act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under rfra the court ruling said bruce rich an orthodox jewish prisoner in florida wanted kosher meals but the warden said no so rich sued the state prison system in saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law rich is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents in their s in allegedly to inherit their home the prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns namely retaliation against the kosher inmates if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food court papers said at least other states and the federal government however provided kosher diets to inmates after losing before a magistrate rich won an appeal before the th circuit court which cited the defendant s meager efforts to explain why florida s prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in florida recently baptized in the sikh faith kawal tagore went to her job with the irs in houston in carrying a new religious item a inch kirpan a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith but the federal government banned her from the building citing the kirpan as a dangerous weapon with a more than inch blade and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace tagore sued the government under the federal law tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects real inch blade knives and metal canes said her attorneys with the newar law firm and the becket fund also federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives in november the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of tagore s trial the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing the christian science monitor reported tagore s attorneys described the settlement as a groundbreaking policy allowing sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings they said in a statement invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn t always equate to victory in chicago an association of churches called the civil liberties for urban believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones the ministers needed a special use permit but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one the church leaders claimed in fact it was easier to get a club lodge or community center approved so the pastors sued the city of chicago in alleging that its zoning laws violated the illinois religious freedom statute the federal religious land use and institutionalized persons act and the u s constitution but in the th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group s claims finding no substantial burden on the churches which also failed to establish their rluipa claim defeated church leaders were angry the forty churches in c l u b and certainly people of all faiths throughout chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the religious land use and institutionalized persons act passed unanimously by congress in apostle theodore wilkinson the group s chairman said in a statement also alarming is the court s conclusion that chicago s religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws the majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing he said at the same time the city of chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid the threat of heightened scrutiny under rluipa according to a league of california cities report in

president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president reaching a good solid agreement with iran is a worthy desirable goal but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations weakening america s hand and strengthening iran obama s political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager even desperate side in these talks even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions the country whose only significant export oil lost more than half of its value in recent months the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b few believe it particularly in the middle east and notably among america s arab friends who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it iran is having a great obama administration that s a belief that has already started shaking up the region saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped and there is little doubt that other countries among iran s muslim rivals will do the same in fact the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by iran s allies we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in when then sen obama said he would meet iran s leaders without preconditions leading his rival hillary clinton to call the idea irresponsible and frankly naive as the years of his presidency unfolded and the middle east started coming apart finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obama s march deadline the u s imposed deadline served only to pressure the united states and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a bad tactic that bad tactic was a political move a push to produce some sort of result however vague to protect the talks from critics again a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development but the agreement so far does not look promising it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed in a presidential debate in obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations the deal we ll accept is they end their nuclear program it s very straightforward nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program not even close iran will be allowed to keep one third of its more than centrifuges that s not a small symbolic number and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled although fordow will contain no nuclear materials iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses the fact is that iran has a well established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to u n inspectors and the u n agency chief says that has not stopped a couple of weeks ago with days left until the negotiating deadline u n nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is for a peaceful purpose he warned the negotiations starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible and preferably forever the world only learned about iran s secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm iran we have learned repeatedly is very good at lying to international inspectors it is well established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program it is well established that many of iran s neighbors don t trust it and are anxious about the u s led international dealings with iran it is well established that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon nuclear enrichment will continue although at a lower level iran officially legally becomes a nuclear threshold state with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a breakout period of one year the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act even the fordow facility conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain will remain in existence though converted to a nuclear research facility and without nuclear material on site international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place even if operating at a reduced pace giving iran much of what it wanted with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel nonnegotiable and threatening saudi arabia this deal does not look reassuring obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option but the deal so far looks like another win for iran it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east

according to an outside review by columbia journalism school professors a n institutional failure at rolling stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the university of virginia the columbia team concluded that the failure encompassed reporting editing editorial supervision and fact checking hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication the magazine s managing editor will dana wrote we would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout including members of the phi kappa psi fraternity and uva administrators and students brian stelter fraternity to pursue all available legal action the next question is can uva phi kappa psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation the virginia supreme court said in jordan v kollman that the elements of libel are publication of an actionable statement with the requisite intent actionable means the statement must be both false and defamatory of course the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the first amendment to the united states constitution but also the virginia constitution true statements cannot be defamatory neither can pure statements of opinion because they theoretically cannot be either true or false but the rolling stone article certainly purported to be fact and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers true the individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals and not public figures the latter have a harder time proving defamation a private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person s reputation the private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis or acted negligently in checking the facts at first blush that sounds like it fits perfectly right the columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent but that s only half the battle there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this the identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters first let s eliminate uva the university is a public university and therefore it is a governmental entity the supreme court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government the government cannot sue for defamation there is no such cause of action in american jurisprudence now the fraternities starting with phi kappa psi a fraternity is not an individual but a group a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were of or concerning the plaintiff it sounds obvious but if you re going to say a statement hurt you you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with when the statements are about a group without naming an individual it s hard to say the statement is concerning the individual and groups generally cannot sue for example you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group s individual members for the most part like all rules however there are exceptions if the defamatory language is about a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group an individual member may sue if i said the philadelphia phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals they weren t the individual players could sue because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons if i said that which i didn t phi kappa psi would likely argue that the small group exception fits it perfectly even if the individual members were not identified by name the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members who have suffered by their association with the group on the other hand rolling stone s lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid after all the membership changes somewhat every year that even though the fraternity s reputation is tarnished the members have suffered no individualized injury as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story that s likely a group that moves from the small category to large and the members of greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on facebook but that such cases are rarely actually filed that s because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm so if your aunt edna calls you a loser on twitter you re going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially and since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on facebook live in their moms basements and are between jobs these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place the uva situation is not your run of the mill defamation case the university won t be able to sue but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim and they can make a tangible case for damages then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases
one of tokyo s most prominent districts has taken a small but potentially significant step to recognizing same sex unions in japan the government of shibuya ward one of the capital s most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts passed ordinance on wednesday paving the way for partnership certificates for same sex couples allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples same sex partners who are registered with the district s ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co sign tenancy agreements other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy such as joint filing of taxes are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities the measure was proposed in february by shibuya s mayor toshitake kuwahara while the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative japan say that the ward s decision is a step in the right direction it is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing gon matsunaka a gay rights activist told cnn while shibuya s decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities what is important for the lgbt lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community in shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society matsunaka said it could be a strong driver for shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems lgbt people are facing taiga ishikawa tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japan told cnn the ordinance was a big first step for the protection of human rights he called the decision happy but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles he said that the most important part of today s announcement is that it should be actually put into practice as should education for understanding lgbt individuals especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young neighboring setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following shibuya s lead however former councilor ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement s momentum for granted to realize equal rights for gay couples a national law has to be made he said while outright discrimination against the lgbt community is rare in japan its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage many hide their sexuality from their employers co workers families and friends but the tide may be turning a recent poll found that a slight majority at oppose gay marriage but support amongst young adults in their s and s is as high as an editorial in the asahi shimbun newspaper which commissioned the poll welcomed the shibuya decision calling it a bold and important step forward only traditional marriages are recognized under japan s constitution but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation according to mari miura a professor of gender and politics at sophia university in tokyo the constitution does not rule out same sex marriage so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional miura told bloomberg business while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party don t like the idea of same sex marriage but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum conservative groups were vocal in their opposition with one known as the network pushing for normalization of education telling the japan times that granting same sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history while shibuya s registration system will be a first for japan yodogawa ward in the western japanese city of osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the lgbt community in the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to lgbt individuals journalist chie kobayashi contributed reporting from tokyo

the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs and the charges are serious indeed a count indictment filed in federal court in california bristles with accusations of conspiracies transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions violations of the controlled substances act misbranding charges and money laundering charges who is this menace to society fedex yes the courier delivery service wait can companies even be charged with crimes where would a fedex be incarcerated is there a corporate shawshank prison how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person it s a practice the supreme court has approved of for over a century in fact in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people corporations don t have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive but corporate convictions on the other hand turn tidy profits for the u s government with zero prison overhead even if corporations can be held criminally liable should a courier service like fedex be held liable for possessing what bad guys may send through the service the answer according to fedex is not just no but a no so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom the company maintains that it is innocent it has a point possession is an elusive concept when it comes to drugs the law recognizes two kinds of possession actual and constructive actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket you actually possess those things the somewhat hazier concept of constructive possession means you can possess something without even having it on your person as long as you have ownership dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found for example the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the oxycontin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway you constructively possessed them conversely sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle but not possess it either actually or constructively in the eyes of the law such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home walk up to your door and hand you a package completely ignorant about what is inside it it s hard to argue the ups guy intentionally possessed your subscription to porno mags in their nondescript brown packaging that is the idea behind the common carrier exception to possession and a large part of fedex s compelling legal argument a common carrier is one who offers its services to members of the public without much discretion and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation the public policy reasons behind common carrier exemptions make sense the industry simply couldn t function if every driver courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of oxycontin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door that would lead to an absurd result that s why the controlled substances act and the food drug and cosmetic act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances so long as it is in the usual course of their business of course this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves common carriers that s why the usual course of business language acts as an additional safety measure in court papers fedex s lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from jamaica to miami this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public generally on the other hand fedex argues that it is indeed a common carrier performing the normal duties of a common carrier because a it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and b it offers its services to the public generally it s hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband does this mean a greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs but if the guy boards the bus with a grateful dead t shirt and a set of bongos shouldn t the driver at least have a hunch that seems dangerously close to profiling is this another illogical straw man argument maybe obviously the department of justice disagrees which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution according to the indictment from at least as early as the drug enforcement administration the food and drug administration and members of congress put fedex on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the controlled substances act the food drug and cosmetic act and numerous state laws the indictment alleges that as early as fedex knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts fedex s couriers in kentucky tennessee and virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to fedex senior management the doj is making the argument that even though fedex carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public fedex knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity it raises a larger question though why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we can t even incarcerate the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs and drug smugglers smuggle them money power the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations in this case it would be to force fedex to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in deferred prosecution agreements the reason you don t see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements for a company a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence whether or not it s found guilty still every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence by agreeing to pay some fines don t get me wrong i m all about prosecuting the black market especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with v agra in the subject line for our co workers to see while we go to the bathroom i want those guys locked up for sure i m just not sure that fedex has anything to do with the kingpins of the fr cyalis email campaign the doj s underlying intentions are noble enough this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain it makes good strategic sense it might seem like good financial sense in the short run with the millions in fines extracted from corporations but that money has to come from somewhere it s just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights it probably doesn t make good legal sense either yes we have been treating corporations as fictional persons for centuries in some ways but it s silly to treat them as persons in all ways fedex has a strong argument for dismissal in this case but even if not it won t be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon

sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me jesus tells the rich man in one of his best known parables it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly the poor were blessed and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well to do to enter paradise meanwhile jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support so how did this wandering band of first century evangelists support themselves clearly money was a concern and not just as an impediment to salvation in the new testament money gets mentions while gold gets citations silver merits and copper four coin comes up eight times and purse and denarii the roman currency get half a dozen mentions each for a total of currency referrals perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament as the gospel of john tells it six days before passover jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus whom he had raised from the dead a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus she dries his feet with her hair an irresistible image for artists and dramatists judas iscariot objected to the act why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor judas asks though denarii was the annual wage of a laborer jesus told judas to leave her alone and foreshadowing his fate said the anointing would be useful for his burial and besides you always have the poor with you but jesus would not always be there what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive so how much i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level rabbi joshua garroway a professor of early christianity and the second commonwealth at hebrew union college in los angeles jesus and his disciples walked wore what they had slept outside or in stayed in friends homes they ate what they caught or what others shared i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of jesus and the companions with whom he traveled garroway said garroway said that it was possible even likely that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite or perhaps because of his preaching on the perils of wealth the gospel of luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ministry functioned on a practical level soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out and joanna the wife of herod s steward chuza and susanna and many others who provided for them out of their resources so according to luke women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their resources with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention one by virtue of her husband and the other by her stature in the story of jesus joanna was an upper class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of herod antipas the son of herod the great the violent and ambitious head of judea as part of this volatile but powerful household joanna would be uniquely positioned to help jesus with her resources being both wealthy and having palace connections she attends to him during his life and the gospels tell us after his death as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty with her on that morning is mary magdalene also identified as among other things a financial supporter of jesus mary likely came from the prosperous town of magdala on the sea of galilee as home to a thriving fishing industry as well as dye and textile works mary could well have come from an affluent family or have been a successful business woman herself mary magdalene was free to travel the country with jesus and his disciples so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home and in finding jesus we examine the gnostic gospel of mary magdalene and explore the argument that jesus was in fact her husband she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message and messenger not only was mary magdalene one of jesus most devoted followers who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem from the ministry to the cross and the tomb but also she provided for him from her own means said mark goodacre a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university when the gospels speak of her ministering to jesus they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in jesus everyday mission goodacre continues along with other women like joanna and susanna she was one of those who made his mission viable along with these women men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus both men of stature and wealth may have chipped in to help fund jesus ministry the gospels reveal that both these men were rich and supported jesus indeed it was joseph who removed jesus from the cross on good friday anointing his body with the help of nicodemus and placing him in the tomb that joseph had reserved for himself after the resurrection on that first easter sunday the movement jesus started grew exponentially and the church s relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater michael mckinley is co author with david gibson of finding jesus faith fact forgery six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels

when i was elected to the kentucky state senate in i became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body five decades later i find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation but that is what rand paul who today declared he s running for president of the united states is doing his campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about expanding the republican party a message of inclusion but those of us listening today who he is hoping to include heard nothing more than hype i m not buying it since coming to the u s senate paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of republican he s tried to brand himself as the gop s minority outreach candidate the problem for paul and the gop at large is that they don t back up their words with their policies yes it s about time that republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle but they can t actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities a quick survey of sen paul s positions makes clear that he does not paul kicked off his announcement speech in louisville by declaring i have a message that is loud and clear we have come to take our country back i have no doubt that under paul s leadership he would indeed take our country back in the wrong direction way back to a time when we were debating the civil rights act which paul has done since landing on the national stage when there was no department of education a department he thinks should be done away with when women didn t have choices choices paul seeks to limit in washington when dreamers weren t protected from deportation protections paul currently opposes in his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency but paul has also questioned the civil rights act and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate when asked about the need for a more robust voting rights act following the supreme court s dismantling of the law paul dismissively remarked we have an african american president when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the th anniversary of bloody sunday he inspired us all by saying with effort we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity with effort we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge and that is the right to vote america is better and we solve more problems with more democracy not less unfortunately rand paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle paul tried once again from that stage in louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated outside of the mainstream and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country the american people deserve a leader who won t disrespect their intelligence who won t pander to them when it s convenient and who won t work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades what i heard today didn t change the facts about rand paul s record the american people deserve better than rand paul

cedar falls iowa cnn as aides politely tried to rush ted cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids iowa on thursday the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him finally after the selfies and conversations started to die down his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall burly man stopped him senator he said can i pray with you real quick yeah cruz said as he clasped the man s upper arm and the two bowed their heads it was one of the many moments when cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week as the senator from texas hit the trail in iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate being the only official contender in the race cruz drew large crowds during his two day swing across the state he s counting on iowa known for its vocal and active evangelical base to propel him forward in what s expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of gop candidates cruz himself displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room the senator regularly avoids using a podium instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone a scene reminiscent of a sunday morning sermon when he meets with people after events he embraces each one s hand with both of his softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye a familiar interaction between churchgoing christians and their pastors the past two winners of iowa s caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right and cruz who announced his bid last month at the well known baptist school liberty university is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize evangelicals make up a large segment of iowa s republican voter bloc according to a des moines register bloomberg politics poll from january of likely republican caucus goers said they were born again or evangelical christians cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck gop leadership on fiscal issues but he showed in iowa last week that he s also eager to champion social issues at a time when many republicans are anxious to avoid them he was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in indiana which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians he described the outrage over the laws as shameful and an assault on first amendment rights there are a lot of people here in iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking watching what has happened in the last two weeks cruz said friday night at an event in des moines we have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty related republican hopefuls back indiana s religious freedom law he s more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a christian and a pastor rafael cruz who s become a celebrity among christian conservatives will frequently visit iowa over the next year cruz told voters and cruz s iowa director bryan english is a former pastor cruz s first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on fox news and nbc that are pegged to easter sunday in the ad cruz talks about the impact of the transformative love of jesus christ on his life while neither mike huckabee who won iowa in nor rick santorum who won in went on to win the nomination their successes helped launch them into high profile battles with the then front runners and with both of them likely running again in the competition will be stiff that s why for cruz courting evangelicals is only a component of a three pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base his stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction he received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the irs and in a knock against the national security agency he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so president obama can hear every word i have to say cruz argued thursday that the republican party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the ron paul rand paul faction of the party young libertarian minded voters and the santorum base evangelicals the two blocs he said are not necessarily the best of chums if we re going to win we ve got to bring that coalition together he said in cedar falls and i think we can do that cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to levels when more than six in evangelicals voted in the presidential election a higher than normal turnout for the demographic that number has waned slightly since but it s not too far off from the of the overall population that voted in still his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who ve been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls if you look at available places for the party to expand the vote it doesn t exist in the middle it exists in the evangelical vote said rick tyler a top cruz adviser it isn t a pond it s an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative russell moore president of the ethics religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in no matter who the nominee is or what that person says moore points to hot button topics like religious freedom issues in the u s as well as increased attention to the killing of minority christians in the middle east and rising anti semitism i don t think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith moore said i think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good later in april voters in iowa will see the bulk of the gop field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the iowa faith and freedom coalition while the past two winners of the iowa caucuses santorum and huckabee are likely running for president again steve scheffler president of the group argued that the field is wide open in terms of who s going to win favor among evangelicals jeb bush while not popular among conservative activists was known for his staunch anti abortion record as florida governor and touts his catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views scott walker is the son of a pastor ben carson the former neurosurgeon rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the obama administration at a national prayer breakfast and other likely candidates from marco rubio to rick perry to rand paul have made serious efforts to court the religious right it s up for grabs it s a clean slate regardless of if you ve run before scheffler said naturally those two huckabee and santorum have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past but by and large voters are going to say let me take a good look at all of these candidates

easter is unique on the christian calendar a major point in the cycle of the religious year and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas that s in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses and patterns can operate in ways that affect our lives nevertheless i m often surprised by how little people even those supposedly within the christian tradition actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics and tolerance that have profound religious implications it s worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday and the awareness of the human condition in all its sadness and glory that it engenders after all holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent still the fuss must puzzle those looking on wondering what it all means why do christians make so much of this springtime week and make so much of easter weekend there is a phrase that many never come across even among christians easter triduum this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday proceed through holy saturday and conclude with easter sunday it s definitely a progression although the word itself triduum can refer to any three days of prayer easter triduum has a kind of major prologue in maundy thursday the day when by tradition jesus celebrated the last supper with his disciples in the upper room in jerusalem on the night before he was crucified the idea of holy communion begins with this meal which was a passover meal jesus of course was jewish as were all his disciples he was never trying to erase judaism and found a new religion his work involved modifying and extending judaism in fresh ways on maundy thursday christians sometimes practice the washing of feet recalling that jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the last supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility showing that he was himself a servant and modeling a kind of ideal behavior good friday isn t in fact so good it s the day of the crucifixion when jesus was scourged and beaten forced to carry his cross to golgotha the place of the skull and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death the actual scene of the crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel as do his last words assembled into the so called seven last words of jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels some of these words are quotations as when jesus asked god why he has abandoned him this is a quote from the nd psalm which opens my god my god why hast thou forsaken me good friday is a day of death sacrifice displacement fear holy saturday is probably the least understood day of the easter triduum it s a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter this day occupies an anxious space in human experience when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isn t quite erased can t be erased simply by hope it s a day of depression a day of suspension then comes easter with the aura of the resurrection i m always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment when the body of christ becomes what is called a glorified body this was not as i ve said elsewhere the great resuscitation although that s part of it too resurrection implies a total transformation something beyond the physical realm it s very important that almost nobody who encounters jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him know him or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection with its promise of transformation a shift from one form to another and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding the three days of easter the triduum occur only once a year on the calendar but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again we find ourselves emptied out in small ways nailed to our own trees in life embarrassed or broken by life it was the buddha who famously observed that life is suffering good friday embodies the christian version of that truth jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer we must all die perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly our friends and families must die we all experience illness loss sadness a loss of confidence darkness this is simply part of the human experience we dive again and again into holy saturday too a period of transition when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view we know well this in between time it s an anxious passage with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope and we ve all been resurrected again and again perhaps in tiny ways this is the joy of easter and it s not something reserved for one day on the calendar it s there whenever we experience what t s eliot once called the timeless moment which can only occur paradoxically in time itself it s a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time i suspect we all experience the triduum frequently sometimes more than once in a single day but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity and perhaps those who don t that we should expect to move through darkness into light it s a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression it s good cause for celebration too and one that won t easily be co opted by secular culture

a long long time ago those five words when uttered or sung makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean s pop masterpiece american pie it s hard to believe that his phenomenal minute allegory which millions of americans know by heart is years old all sorts of historical cross currents play off each other in this timeless song brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus which starts as bye bye miss american pie there is no real way to categorize mclean s american pie for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad beer hall chant and high art rock on tuesday christie s sold the page handwritten manuscript of the song s lyrics for million to an unnamed buyer mclean was a paperboy when on february he saw that buddy holly ritchie valens and j p the big bopper richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in clear lake iowa the next day i went to school in shock and guess what mclean recalled nobody cared rock n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy hadn t had a big hit on the charts since by cathartically writing american pie mclean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever having recorded his first album tapestry in in berkeley california during the student riots mclean a native new yorker became a kind of weather vane for what he called the generation lost in space when his cultural anthem american pie was released in november it replaced bob dylan s the times they are a changin as the peoples almanac of the new decade it s important to think of american pie as one would of henry longfellow s evangeline or johnny mercer s moon river an essential americana poem emanating wistful recollection blues valentine and youthful protest rolled into one there is magic brewing in the music and words of american pie for mclean s lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream like those jack kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry infused novel on the road don mclean buddy holly rest in peace influenced by pete seeger and the weavers mclean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early s when american pie topped the billboard charts and has never shed the cape wandering far and wide singing american pie at windblown dance halls in wyoming and cloistered colleges in new england at huge amphitheaters in california and little coffee houses in the hudson river valley mclean has performed his global anthem thousands of times yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure when mclean prods audiences by rhapsodizing and they were singing everybody spontaneously joins in with the bye bye chorus watching mclean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective happening what makes american pie so unusual is that it isn t a relic from the counterculture but a talisman which like a sacred river keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere when american pie suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it s almost impossible not to sing along like danny boy or streets of laredo or shenandoah it s eternal with illusions to football fields and rock n roll river levees and nursery rhymes the song cascades along like a boat going down niagara falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes after all these years american pie still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss the song is alive and joyful yet fretful about a world gone wrong it is a song that will never die a reverie for the ages there is a jump to the chorus which forces the mind to relive the s s and s to troll through the back pages of our lives while like a traditional irish folksong it reminds us of fate while mclean the muse has rightfully not tried to interpret american pie it s fair to surmise that the king is elvis presley helter skelter refers to the charles manson murders the jester on the sidelines in a cast is bob dylan and jack flash the rolling stones but who knows the lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations as a literary artifact of the early s there isn t anything to compare to american pie normally i don t like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents for that matter but the fact that the recording industry of america and the national endowment of the arts chose american pie as the fifth greatest song of the th century speaks to the composition s importance as an enduring piece of pop art the other four were over the rainbow by harold arlen and e y yip harburg white christmas by irving berlin this land is your land by woody guthrie and respect by otis redding that is fine company quite simply american pie is one of the greatest songs ever written and tuesday the original lyrics found a new home

you may know mindy kaling from fox s cult hit comedy the mindy project in which she plays mindy lahiri a perky quirky ob gyn juggling her career and love life in new york only in the big apple can a doctor not afford an apartment the show was a breakthrough for on screen representation the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming season recently however kaling s brother vijay chokalingam unveiled a project of his own and while it has been getting a lot of attention it hasn t generated quite as many laughs either from observers or from his famous sibling who told him it brought shame upon their family you see chokalingam revealed that as an undergraduate at the university of chicago he engaged in a daring his view or ridiculous and offensive pretty much everyone else scam he applied to medical school claiming to be african american chokalingam had spent his college years as a hard partying frat boy and achieved a less than stunning gpa upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options he realized that fellow indian americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice but that black hispanic and native american applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man both to dramatically improve his chances of admission and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools to accomplish this goal chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks trimmed his long indian american eyelashes checked black under the optional race ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to schools under his childhood nickname jojo he received invitations for in person interviews at schools results that he claims support the notion that african americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or asians and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired he s looking to write a book on his experiences titled almost black the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american what s truly curious is that even if you agree with chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of systematic racism when all is said and done it offers very little evidence of the privilege that he claims is accorded to black hispanic and native american candidates chokalingam had mediocre grades and mcats but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation yet even while representing himself as black chokalingam received only a single admission offer to st louis university s school of medicine which falls somewhere between th and th in national rankings harvard university of pennsylvania columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him meanwhile he admits pretending to be black came with disadvantages he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost implying that he must have stolen it these acts of very real prejudice experienced regularly by blacks and hispanics of all backgrounds multimillionaire comedian chris rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason didn t seem to dissuade chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision making it s not just a matter of what individual applicants deserve one third of americans are black hispanic or native american just one in physicians are since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities this lack of diversity has produced doctor deserts in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians years ago when i told my father a doctor from a long line of doctors that i didn t want to follow in his footsteps he told me that was fine because medicine is a service trade and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession a medical degree isn t a reward to be earned he said but a responsibility to be accepted which really cuts to the heart of what s so sad about chokalingam s racial farce like others who ve recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities including putative presidential candidate jeb bush who registered himself as hispanic on a voter form and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people s burden race isn t just about color or blood it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present day condition of a community of people many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive others are deeply painful affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation s history an imperfect one but necessary there are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own industries like health care and hollywood because what s most ironic about chokalingam s decision to ride on his sister s coattails in telling his story while asians are well represented in medicine our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like mindy kaling it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces voices and stories kaling s immense talent and charisma made her a star but it was a quota based affirmative action initiative nbc s diversity writers program that gave her a start

the outlines of a nuclear deal with iran are in place unfortunately it seems like too many in president barack obama s administration have forgotten that the only reason this terrorist supporting state came to the negotiating table in the first place was because of tough sanctions imposed by the u s congress indeed the reality is that president obama is giving up enormous leverage in his nuclear deal with iran and i worry we will lose it for good bleeding money and faced with falling oil prices supreme leader ayatollah khamenei gave his government rare permission to bargain with the great satan the united states but just as u s and european sanctions were forcing iran to the nuclear crossroads president obama has given tehran an easy exit for khamenei the framework announced last week looks like a win win he gets to keep his nuclear infrastructure and in return gets billions of dollars in sanctions relief congress offered a better strategy when the top democrat on the foreign affairs committee eliot engel and i introduced a bill to hit tehran with its toughest sanctions yet unfortunately this bill which passed the house in a vote was blocked in the senate last year despite the fact that it would have sharpened the ayatollah s choice dismantle your nuclear weapons program or see your economy collapse president obama once had a tougher line when in he said the deal we ll accept is they end their nuclear program it s very straightforward but the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort negotiated between iran and the united states russia china britain france and germany the framework concedes that iran can maintain a mutually defined enrichment program operate thousands of centrifuges and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies the deal currently on the table would hand tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds filling the coffers of the world s biggest state sponsor of terrorism with strongholds in syria iraq yemen and lebanon meanwhile the strictest restrictions on iran s enrichment will expire in only years despite the president receiving a letter from members of congress both democrats and republicans in which we insisted that verifiable constraints on iran s nuclear program must last for decades the president admitted as much when he conceded that in year they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero but as bad as these concessions are the most concerning aspect of the april deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop iran from cheating the key question is this will the inspectors at the international atomic energy agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning because if the iaea cannot conduct anytime anywhere inspections iran will be able to sneak out to a bomb it has been done before remember in when president bill clinton told us he had struck a deal with north korea that would make the united states the korean peninsula and the world safer president clinton sounded a little too much like the current secretary of state john kerry when he promised that the north korea agreement does not rely on trust and that compliance will be certified by the international atomic energy agency twelve years after these assurances north korea detonated its first nuclear bomb iran could easily do the same the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior between and the iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named fordo under a mountain deep in the iranian desert luckily for the world western intelligence agencies discovered tehran s deception but we cannot rely on such luck in the future particularly when iran still hasn t come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the iaea let s not forget the other things iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the u s and its partners while iran was showing its friendly new face to the world it has simultaneously been helping syrian dictator bashar al assad kill his own people training and funding the terrorist group hezbollah which aims to annihilate israel and supporting the houthis who started a civil war and overthrew the government in yemen one of america s more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region if president obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this run by a man who publicly declares death to america it has to be a better deal the framework we have before us keeps iran s nuclear door well and truly open
the vii summit of the americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the united states and cuba but insert venezuela into the mix and panama city panama quickly turns into a triangle of tension heads of state from countries in the western hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic social or political issues since the creation of the summit in cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery with some latin american leaders threatening not to attend the summit of the americas if the united states and canada didn t agree to invite president raul castro the tide changed december when president barack obama and castro announced that more than five decades of cold war rivalry was ending diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in havana and washington and the attention immediately focused on the summit of the americas where for the first time since the about face obama and castro would come face to face the much anticipated handshake between obama and castro would steal all the headlines if it wasn t for cuba s strongest ally venezuela venezuelan president nicolas maduro recently accused the united states of trying to topple his government and banned former president george bush former vice president dick cheney and senators bob menendez and marco rubio from entering venezuela they can t enter venezuela because they re terrorists maduro said blaming the american politicians for what he called terrorist actions in iraq syria and vietnam the u s state department said the allegations of u s involvement in a coup plot against maduro were baseless and false later obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven venezuelan officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a threat to national security white house officials said every executive order includes that language but it has sparked a fiery response from maduro who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order he also asked for repeal in full page ads in the new york times and in a panama city newspaper maduro didn t stop there he has been rallying other latin american leaders including bolivian president evo morales ecuador s rafael correa and nicaragua s daniel ortega but perhaps most damning for the united states and creating the triangle of tension at the summit cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez has sided publicly with maduro we reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of venezuela and the continued foreign interference with the purpose of creating a climate of instability in that sister nation we ratify our firmest support to the bolivarian revolution and the legitimate government headed by president nicolás maduro rodriguez said while the world watches for the photo op of obama and castro it s unclear if more latin american diplomats will side with maduro and for america the vii summit of the americas could go from mi casa es su casa to a walk into the lion s den
waterloo iowa cnn martin o malley and jim webb share little in common both democrats are toying with a presidential run both are facing long odds in that endeavor and both shared a stage at the polk county democrats awards dinner in des moines iowa on friday night but as was evident at the dinner that is where the similarities end o malley is a former mayor and maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand webb on the contrary is a decorated vietnam war veteran and former senator from virginia who comes across as more stoic and at times uncomfortable with retail politics before the event o malley confidently cruised the union hall he took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances it is a marathon not a sprint one man told o malley a nod to his long odds in the democratic nomination process yes it is it s a marathon o malley responded welcome to iowa said another man we hope to see you here more o malley smiled thanks a lot i hope you do too webb wasn t nearly as active opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him as webb cut into his sizable helping of pork o malley was standing directly behind him shaking hands the former virginia senator after possibly seeing o malley making the rounds did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard democratic activists in the room seven months old zach smith a new father said of his baby boy noah i have a bunch of kids the youngest one is years old webb said the baby looked up at the senator he is pretty calm webb remarked himself calm despite coming from bordering states webb and o malley don t know each other when they passed each other in a des moines hotel lobby on friday morning it was the first time the two had met that said the two democrats find themselves in the same position hillary clinton the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid sunday leads every national and state poll of the democratic field she has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination o malley and webb are both looking up at her in a march cnn orc poll pdf of national democrats only said o malley and webb were their top choice in a january poll from bloomberg politics and the des moines register pdf o malley was at among iowa democrats while webb found himself at the speaking portion of the night further showed webb and o malley s differences webb who spoke before the governor gave a more subdued biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president basic governance economic justice and criminal justice reform to the approval of the audience webb promised to come back to iowa regularly i am committing to you right now he said we are going to go over the whole state and the biggest applause came near the end of his speech when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues money is ruining our political process webb said to a chorus of applause and hear hear o malley on the other hand gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines at points the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands when the american dream is denied our lives shrink our hopes fade and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear o malley said delivering the same stump speech he usually gives to make the dream true again we must fight for better wages for all workers so that americans can support their families on what they earn as the event wound down webb and o malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people o malley who spent the previous day in iowa left friday night for new york webb who is in the midst of a four day trip to iowa stayed in des moines and headlined a veterans event on saturday morning in waterloo webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event he told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans he also touted his work on passing the st century g i bill of rights a act that expanded education benefits for veterans and stressed that more needed to be done you want the next greatest generation give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had webb said to applause if you really want to thank them hire a vet after the event webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the department of veterans affairs he occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny saturday morning asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like iowa and new hampshire webb smiled skepticism of retail politics is not new for webb as a one term democratic senator webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning namely fundraising and retail politics this time he put on a rosy view this is the good part of it webb said with a laugh talking to the media that is not always the good part
mullah mohammed omar is still the leader of the taliban s self declared islamic emirate of afghanistan that appears to be the primary message of a biography just published by the taliban of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early s the taliban s cultural commission released the page document in several different translations on the movement s website ostensibly to commemorate the th anniversary of an april meeting in afghanistan s kandahar province when an assembly of afghans swore allegiance to omar several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of omar s demise there have been a lot of rumors lately about him some people are saying that he is not alive said sayyed muhammad akbar agha a former taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement i think the taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present agha told cnn in a telephone interview bergen why u s must stay in afghanistan past the biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the afghan s jihadi leadership credentials at a time when isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi has declared himself caliph of the world s muslims the taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment said graeme smith a kabul based analyst for the international crisis group another caliph has announced himself to the world and the taliban has been silent and that is getting noticed by militants across south asia omar was famously camera shy during the taliban s six year rule over most of afghanistan to this day there are only a handful of photographs of the one eyed leader he never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns no publicity no interviews he never used the internet said rahimullah yusufzai a pakistani journalist and expert on afghanistan who once interviewed osama bin laden omar then all but disappeared after a u s led bombing campaign routed the taliban from kabul in washington has offered a million reward for his capture the taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader in hiding but years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that omar may have died the biography challenges rumors of omar s death by offering a description of his daily work schedule which begins with prayers study of the quran and then delivering orders in a specific way to his jihadi commanders the publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant s early years including the detail that his preferred weapon of choice was the rpg a rocket propelled grenade according to the biography omar was born in in a village called chah i himmat in afghanistan s kandahar province his father a well known and respected erudite and social figure died only five years later apparently of natural causes omar studied at a religious school or madrassa run by his uncle the rise of the communist party in afghanistan and the subsequent soviet invasion interrupted the young man s studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen for the next decade omar commanded rebel groups against the invading russians and their internal communist puppets according to the biography along the way he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye in one battle the biography claims omar and a fighter named mullah biradar akhund destroyed four soviet tanks even though they were armed with only four rpg rounds the taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the u s allied with saudi arabia and pakistan helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the soviet army withdrew in defeat in afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in kabul collapsed in the movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power the taliban biography says that omar and his compatriots launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy after an initial meeting in kandahar in june two years later the taliban captured kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of islamic law on the rest of the country while the document denounces the taliban s post overthrow at the hands of a u s backed coalition of rival afghan fighters it makes no mention of the taliban s alliance with bin laden and al qaeda during a decade in exile the saudi born bin laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by u s raid on his hideout in the pakistani city of abbottabad in though taliban militants have continued to battle the u s backed government across afghanistan omar has not been seen or heard from in years the movement claims he continues to oversee a taliban leadership council judiciary and nine executive commissions as well as military commanders who operate in all provinces of afghanistan exclusive isis recruits afghans in chilling video cnn s masoud popalzai contributed to this report from kabul afghanistan

i remember the day i stopped praying it was the day after my little brother jimmy died of cancer he was i was so angry at god i was at the time and like most young people i had stopped going to church but on that day that terrible day i desperately needed to understand why god took my brother i called the nearest catholic church looking for a priest a lady picked up the phone can i talk with father i asked i wish i could say her answer was yes instead she asked me if i was a member of that particular parish does it matter i asked at the time i lived far from my home parish i don t remember how she responded but the answer about my being able to see father was clearly no i don t know if all catholic churches would have shut me out but i figured at the time it was part of the long list of rules the vatican required catholic leaders to follow i cried for a bit then decided i would never ask god for anything clearly his conduits on earth did not have time for me a lifelong catholic and sinner so why would he ever since i ve considered myself a lapsed catholic until pope francis there is something about francis that s reawakened my faith and it s not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church he still argues against things i passionately support but i find myself like many other lapsed catholics enthralled recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the pope s newly appointed cardinals his name is cardinal gerald lacroix the year old presides at the basilica cathedral of notre dame in quebec city one of my first questions what is it about pope francis every person is a mystery you know but what s evident is this man is living with such freedom such inner freedom he s himself he s in tune with the lord lacroix told me those close to him say he s up close to in the morning to prepare his daily mass which is at in the morning on the weekdays so that s almost three hours of prayer preparation and silence before the lord and the word of god wow that really fine tunes you to start off a day perhaps that s how the pope stays humble why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled women and those of other faiths why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in st peter s square all of this is appealing but it s more than that in my mind it s his tone when pope francis said if a person is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will who am i to judge the comment took me aback homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the vatican yet pope francis uttered those welcoming words lacroix likened the pope s approach to jesus jesus didn t judge jesus did not come as a judge he came as someone who preached and talked about the love of god those kinds of answers are so different in my experience but i understand why more conservative catholics worry if the pope does not judge then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not i hear that sometimes too lacroix told me i think pope francis is conservative in the right way you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation that s the gospel you cannot reproach pope francis of not living the gospel or not preaching the truth of the gospel but isn t homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church there is room for everyone the door is open cardinal lacroix insisted of course you know that the catholic church will never promote same sex marriage but do we respect homosexual persons do we welcome them do we accompany them of course but to respect the church and its teaching which is based on a long tradition and also the word of god we will not go so far as to bless but that doesn t mean we reject that last sentiment that doesn t mean we reject did it for me i finally understood why pope francis reawakened my faith i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish like not covering my head with a traditional veil at easter like accidentally eating meat on holy friday like supporting the use of contraception but as lacroix told me jesus walked with sinners until the very end he did not banish them to fires of hell for he refused to give up on anyone the cardinal s last words to me i m trying to do my best on the local level to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing to see how we can today respond to those needs i want people to see me and the church as an open heart to grow together not a church that s imposing we have nothing to impose we have someone to propose the lord jesus and his gospel i can t wait to go church next sunday and yes i will bow my head and pray for forgiveness and if i m worthy christ s love

an amnesty international report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women s rights activists in afghanistan the report entitled their lives on the line examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women s rights not only by the taliban and tribal warlords but also by government officials its publication is timely the brutal murder of farkhunda a young woman in afghanistan whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in kabul shocked the world accused of burning pages from the muslim holy book the quran many protested the year old s innocence but what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history women in afghanistan became pallbearers hoisting the victim s coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves under the gazes of men unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women s solidarity as they marched along the streets in a country ranked in by a thomson reuters foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women this feminist act seemed perilous latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard in the u n assistance mission in afghanistan unama released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by from the previous year although the number of civilian victims had decreased said amnesty in the report the special representative of the u n secretary general in afghanistan at the time jan kubis told the u n security council that the majority of women killed is linked to domestic violence tradition culture of the country women activists have been deliberately targeted and according to the human rights group little support has come from those in power the afghan government has done very little to protect them amnesty s afghanistan researcher horia mosadiq tells cnn perpetrators almost always walk free and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded during the attack on farkhunda many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed says mosadiq twenty six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack but she argues that this is insufficient suspending police officers is not enough those who failed in their duty must also be held to account anything less will just encourage further mob violence but what is striking is the resilience of the activists who continue their work despite their lives being on the line it was a remarkable moment says mosadiq recalling the female protesters at farkhunda s funeral unlike anything i have seen in my decades of campaigning for women s rights in our country selay ghaffer is a women s rights activist and spokesperson for the solidarity party of afghanistan a small but outspoken political party based in kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy social justice and women s rights the party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice taking part in farkhunda s funeral and protests against her death she tells cnn that despite the onslaught of violence against afghan women over the years this was the worst case but the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message so the women of afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore and we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women said ghaffer so this is why we decided to carry the dead body of farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that a man has to do this job surprisingly she says that male onlookers supported their mission although they are in the minority overall in the country men at the funeral they said you have to do this because this is how you can change the hatred in afghanistan without men it is not possible for women to get their rights she says so these men and women were working together but at the same time women need to step forward for their rights mosadiq says the fight for women s rights was established a while ago women s activism in afghanistan is nothing new the women s rights movement has grown substantially since and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains these gains are under threat now however and some are even rolled back it s essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work received through emails and phone calls at her home and office but she says she knew what she was getting herself into i knew it wasn t an easy task there might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights as a woman i want to struggle more for my rights i want to have more people around me to struggle with me mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution although the response to farkhunda s killing from both men and women has been a silver lining ghaffer however believes this is the beginning of an uprising but she says it needs to keep moving interestingly it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight i must say strongly that it was my father who inspired me who is not any more with me because he died three months ago she says he always told me that women always suffered in this country she says her voice overcome with emotion and you have to struggle for your rights because in this traditional patriarchal society nobody will give these rights to you she realizes how lucky she is she adds in a society where she has witnessed men fathers and husbands oppressing women as opposed to being their role models ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women not least to the victim of the recent horrific mob violence so if i should not do it if another sister is not

washington cnn an iranian military observation aircraft flew within yards of an armed u s navy helicopter over the persian gulf this month sparking concern that top iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces cnn has learned the incident which has not been publicly disclosed troubled u s military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident it also surprised u s commanders because in recent months iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner one u s military official told cnn we think this might have been locally ordered the official said the incident took place as the u s and other world powers meet with iran in switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting tehran s nuclear program at the same time iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the persian gulf and neighboring regions the navy mh r armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the uss carl vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace the official said an unarmed iranian observation y aircraft approached the iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter coming within yards before the helicopter moved off according to the official the official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a predictable manner so the iranians could not misinterpret any u s intentions the navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter but there was no contact between the two aircraft and no shots were fired the navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing them the u s administration is considering a potential demarche protest against iran the official said cnn has reached out to iranian officials but has not received a response this type of iranian observation aircraft generally operates over the gulf several times a month but after the recent incident u s naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher ups the pentagon has noted for the last several years that most encounters with the iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally but that some missions run by iranian revolutionary guard corps forces have been too aggressive against u s forces in the area the u s military s concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter this incident might have been buffoonery the official said but there is always a risk from such actions the incident comes as the navy patrols the gulf of aden to watch for iranian ships the u s believes are trying to bring weapons to resupply the houthi rebels in yemen the navy would share such intelligence with saudi arabia a second u s official told cnn

charleston south carolina cnn police officers saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of walter scott to his south carolina funeral service where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in america a pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer to a service open to the public an overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy april afternoon at w o r d ministries christian center in summerville which has a capacity of about people the flag draped casket of the u s coast guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as scott s relatives and friends followed some dabbed tears others embraced hundreds including local officials assembled inside the packed sanctuary in corridors under an awning at the entrance wherever they could stand silence filled the vast space as scott s daughter samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father anthony scott said god had selected his brother as a candidate for change in america the change will come he said bringing to the crowd to its feet the head of the church george hamilton spoke of how scott had brought members of his family to the church of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video the death of scott who was black at the hands of a white police officer was motivated by racial prejudice hamilton said it was an act of overt racism hate came because walter was an african american he said hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement but he singled out the officer who killed scott as a disgrace to the north charleston police department there is gong to be change he said walter s death will not be in vain after the service pallbearers gently lifted scott s casket into the hearse crowds poured from the church a slow moving procession of black cars then made its way to live oak memorial gardens in charleston for the private burial chris stewart an attorney for the scott family said the death represented more than an race issue it s a human issue he said we re getting emails from people in arkansas telling us i m a white male and i m supporting this family their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other on friday night scott s open casket was draped with an american flag and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in charleston a dallas cowboys banner his favorite nfl team was placed outside the casket and a figurine of a cowboys player stood at his side but scott s family was missing they needed privacy said charleston mayor joseph riley who attended a week ago scott was killed in north charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight a passer by caught the shooting on cell phone video and officer michael slager was swiftly charged with murder he was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted who was walter scott the video shows scott running from an officer who fires eight shots scott is struck five times he falls to the ground nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer s life or the life of another was threatened national urban league president marc morial said the question here is whether the use of force was excessive but one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting and at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up on thursday gwen nichols told cnn s brian todd that she saw scott and slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot it was like a tussle type of thing like you know like what do you want or what did i do type of thing nichols said i didn t hear mr slager saying stop nichols account has similarities to slager s he had told investigators that he had tussled with scott over his taser and that he feared for his safety a timeline of events criminal defense attorney paul callan said he believes slager s defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting that this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation a physical altercation with a suspect callan said and that would constitute manslaughter under law as opposed to murder and it makes a huge difference in sentencing in south carolina a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation but the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video feidin santana paints a different picture he was walking to work when he saw slager on top of scott he said who was on the ground santana said he could hear the sound of a taser in use he said he didn t see scott go after the taser as slager initially claimed he said he believes scott was trying to get away mr scott never tried to fight santana said neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video because santana started recording shortly after that investigators from the south carolina law enforcement division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start it said in a statement we believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter division chief mark keel said in a statement the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions slager s lawyer andy savage has complained that he has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has savage s office said in a statement that it has yet to receive any investigative documents audio or video tapes other than a copy of mr slager s arrest warrant the news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that slager belongs to is no longer involved in the case charleston county sheriff al cannon said slager s wife jamie who is eight months pregnant and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center friday slager was being held in isolation and being monitored for his mental health cannon said in a statement one of slager s lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour his wife and mom were tearful but strong and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person even if separated by a thick pane of glass the statement said they held up family photos and even jamie s ultrasound from earlier that day to remind him of all those who love him throughout the visit michael was focused on jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families a second video taken from a police dash cam has also emerged from the day scott died it shows moments before the shooting when things seemed to be going smoothly between scott and slager scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle and slager returns to his car to do paperwork then scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera s frame scott was the subject of a bench warrant over in unpaid child support at the time of the stop according to court records that was why he ran lawyers for the family said after the funeral service u s rep james clyburn d south carolina told reporters outside the service that scott lost a a year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support he said it was the best job he s ever had clyburn said now you have to ask if you want to collect child support there s got to be income and you ain t going to make much income from jail it seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom on friday afternoon police met with a man who was in scott s car but the passenger s name wasn t in a police report obtained by cnn he was detained briefly after the shooting one officer wrote in the report scott family attorney chris stewart said he was a co worker and friend but he did not identify the passenger by name on friday a few mourners trickled into the fielding home for funerals a white banner with a blue star near scott s casket displayed his favorite nfl team it said tradition the cowboys way this is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community

for years adelma cifuentes felt worthless frightened and alone never knowing when her abusive husband would strike but as a young mother in rural guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education she thought there was no way out what began as psychological torment name calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe cifuentes feared for her life one day two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her they probably would have succeeded but after the first bullet was fired cifuentes two sons dragged her inside still in her deeply conservative community it took neighbors two hours to call for help and cifuentes lost her arm but the abuse didn t stop there when she returned home cifuentes husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left that s when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began cifuentes case is dramatic but in guatemala where nearly out of every women are killed it s hardly unusual a small arms survey says gender based violence is at epidemic levels in guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide according to the united nations two women are killed there every day there are many reasons why beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country s year old civil war during the conflict atrocities were committed against women who were used as a weapon of war in a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions many remain in power and they have not changed the way they view women some people were either killed or disappeared during the decades long conflict most of them from indigenous mayan populations nearly years later according to the security sector reform resource centre levels of violent crime are higher in guatemala than they were during the war but despite the high homicide rate the united nations estimates of cases never make it to court women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny in many cases femicide the killing of a woman simply because of her gender is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war including rape torture and mutilation mexican drug cartels organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness authorities investigating drug related killings are stretched thin leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides in many cases crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation many consider the guatamalen national civil police or pnc corrupt under resourced and ineffective even if a case does get prosecuted according to human rights watch the country s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in guatemala is the country s deeply rooted patriarchal society according to maría machicado terán the representative of u n women in guatemala of men believe that women need permission to leave the house and of women surveyed agreed this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence rights groups say machismo not only condones violence it places the blame on the victim the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize politicians don t think women are important says former secretary general of the presidential secretariat for women elizabeth quiroa political parties use women for elections they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty many girls especially in indigenous communities don t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far quiroa says they are subject to rape violence and forced participation in the drug trade although the situation for girls and women in guatemala is alarming there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing with the help of an organization known as cicam or centro de investigación cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved he is now spending years behind bars cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art since she and four other abuse survivors known as la poderosas or the powerful have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly but it also offers suggestions for change and it s having an impact women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support men are reacting too one of the main characters lesbia téllez says during one presentation a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated he said he wanted to be different the taboo topic of gender based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of guatemala s most vulnerable groups indigenous mayan girls in with help from the united nations and other organizations the population council launched a community based club known as abriendo oportunidades or opening opportunities the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential senior program coordinator alejandra colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time they realize they are entitled to certain rights colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence the guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women in the congress passed a law against femicide two years later the attorney general s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women in the government established a joint task force for crimes against women making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need the government has also established a special hour court to attend to femicide cases on the global front the international violence against women act was introduced in the u s congress in it has been pending ever since but last week the act was reintroduced in both the house and senate if approved it would make reducing levels of gender based violence a u s foreign policy priority pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations which are on the front lines of the fight against gender based discrimination in guatemala ben weingrod a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group care says we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women but the job is far from over while there is tempered optimism and hope for change the problem of gender based violence in guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors which has allowed her to move forward but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures for them it s a race against time and help cannot come soon enough
hillary clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the presidential election although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement for democrats there is ample reason to be excited about clinton s run for the presidency she is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades she brings to the table extensive political and policy experience a combination of skills that is often lacking she has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before she has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies she is a hardened tough partisan who will not shy away from republican attack americans have many positive memories of clinton name given the booming economy of the late s during bill clinton s presidency if hillary clinton puts together an effective campaign she could be unbeatable in the democratic primaries as well as in the general election however during the buildup to her final decision some of her weaknesses have also been exposed clinton doesn t want to end up like vice president al gore in although he did relatively well in the final election with many americans believing that he did actually defeat george w bush he didn t generate much energy once the campaign started although he too was touted as a perfect candidate who was the ideal person for the job something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail he seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling gore had trouble connecting with voters and he seemed to remake his image constantly his biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee rather than what he actually stood for clinton must avoid following gore s path she suffered this fate in the primaries and can t afford to do so again she needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience that is not enough more important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the white house voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change a recent story in the washington post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability after the announcement they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as iowa and new hampshire clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity in his first day on the campaign trail sen rand paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted that question has dogged the clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late s their greatest virtue their immense skills as politicians has often come back to haunt them bill clinton was attacked as slick willie by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and hillary clinton has faced similar criticism when she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in iraq many democrats didn t buy her critique of president george w bush s foreign policies and went for barack obama instead when she conducted her listening tour of new york before running for the senate many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider when she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her state department email some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she wasn t always telling us what she was really about even if she isn t hiding anything she often gives that appearance during the next few months clinton will also have to connect with her party s base the ongoing speculation about sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the democratic party is not that enthused with clinton s candidacy while they will probably vote for her they are not very motivated and don t trust that she will stand for democratic values she will need to address these concerns not through her style but through her agenda voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing she will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with iran clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments about her appearance for instance that won t be aimed at male candidates part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism but the struggle will be tough finally and this relates to the last challenge clinton will have to contend with her husband to be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail one of the most compelling democrats of our generation but he can also be liability as she learned in bill clinton is not always easy to control when he speaks his mind as he did in dismissive comments about obama s candidacy it can often work against her the fund raising records of the clinton foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest and ongoing stories about his personal life as was the case when monica lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago could re emerge on the campaign trail whether that is fair or not is beside the point everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail hillary clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate but she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months
a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release lost river is still causing quite a stir booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers ryan gosling s first feature as director has been divisive to put it mildly but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole its setting a besmirched and decaying detroit wavering on the brink of annihilation yet providing kindling for its own rebirth the city is captured in all its waning splendor the perfect backdrop for gosling s post industrial gothic speaking about the film in london gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project in fact without detroit s crumbling edifices there would be no film at all gosling said that lost river began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster douglass projects the first black social housing development in america and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home i heard the authorities were going to tear them down gosling said i had to shoot them before they did taking time out between acting jobs he ventured into the projects i started shooting more and more he explained and then i realized that i was making a film then i started writing the script during the process of filming gosling s affection for the motor city is longstanding the actor growing up not too far away in cornwall ontario it seemed like everything cool came from detroit the whole american dream he reminisces the model t motown the refrigerator now though he references miles of dead neighborhoods the city declaring bankruptcy houses are burning and things are being torn down he says and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes for them it has become a nightmare and i wanted to make a film about that the title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents man made interference with untold social repercussions speaking in broader terms gosling argues there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having on screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence sometimes self inflicted the director plainly states that as a location it was pretty dangerous he describes an energy there that was threatening we had a very charmed experience filming it worked its way into the fabric of the movie a tone of impending threat that was just there however there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos on camera and off for the film s young protagonist every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed similarly gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion a community organization in the city s mcdougall hunt neighborhood reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists he recalls seeing one house covered with teddy bears another covered in clocks people taking spaces and personalizing them the city s scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw something really interesting is happening in detroit at the moment a rebirth people redefining what they are according to gosling there s a resilience there and an energy and it s exciting as much as the visual content of lost river revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction and perhaps plays on the outside world s perception of detroit aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit and is precisely what the film is trying to convey we want people to know that dereliction is happening there but that it s not only what is happening there he argues it doesn t define detroit it s just part of what it s dealing with right now lost river receives a limited theatrical release in the u s and uk on april

all elizabeth sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home but she couldn t why because according to her she has cancer that s what she said in a video posted to facebook that shows her group packing up from their alaska airlines plane as it sat at the gate in hawaii you re taking me off the airplane because i don t have a doctor s note saying i can fly a woman is heard saying all these people are waiting and i m being removed as if i m a criminal or contagious because i have cancer and no note to fly sedway did eventually get on a flight back to san jose california although she didn t get home until late tuesday night and she got an apology we regret the inconvenience ms sedway experienced and are very sorry for how the situation was handled alaska airlines spokeswoman bobbie egan said while our employee had the customer s well being in mind the situation could have been handled differently her cancer fight notwithstanding sedway was in hawaii in time to celebrate her th wedding anniversary still on monday she was on a plane to head east then according to her facebook post an airline employee who saw sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing the second time she inquired sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak that was followed by a call to a doctor then her removal from the plane egan the alaska airlines spokeswoman acknowledged that the carrier s policy when someone has a medical issue is to call medlink a group of er nurses and doctors the idea she explained is that it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air especially on flights to or from hawaii which in that case would last five plus hours over open ocean the decision to pull sedway from the flight was done with the customer s well being in mind according to egan still that doesn t mean it was the right decision alaska airlines since apologized to sedway for the disruption this has caused in addition to refunding her family s tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations even though she was stuck in hawaii sedway made clear on facebook that this was a real disruption because of this i will miss my chemotherapy my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings she said
there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that rolling stone retracted on sunday night a part of the story that was never disputed the university of virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault even when the student admitted to it the virginia attorney general asked the law firm of o melveny myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students that includes how uva officials handled the allegations in the discredited rolling stone article by a student the magazine called jackie especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out the alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in and jackie told the university about it the next spring she started telling her story very publicly including at a take back the night rally but charlottesville police didn t hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of in which jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault she also told the story of the alleged incident in both cases police said jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case but more women came forward to talk about their experiences women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as jackie s rolling stone s story opened up a conversation about the topic and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims many women told cnn about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus they d call it a bad experience others told cnn that there were fraternities with reputations for being rapey and for using date rape drugs that some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman s outfit and if a woman did report her rape some women complained that the internal process didn t seem worth it if their abuser wouldn t be kicked out of school rolling stone had a line in its original story uva s emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since people have been expelled for honor code violations such as cheating on exams and yet paradoxically not a single student at uva has ever been expelled for sexual assault after the article published uva admitted this and instituted a zero tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward although that policy was never defined so it s unclear what it means when the story was deleted from rolling stone s website that was lost you lose a lot of other people s voices who were in that article said sarah roderick a survivor and uva student and a lot of good things that could have come about fixing problems with administration here and on our campus and she added across the nationo along with the o melveny myers investigation there s also an open title ix investigation into uva by the u s department of education as a result of a civil suit the attorney who filed the suit james marsh told cnn that uva medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he s representing making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice when the columbia journalism school s plus word critique is summed up it really boils down to this the mistake could have been avoided if the writer sabrina rubin erdely had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of jackie who she claimed were with her that night they d later tell other media outlets including cnn that they remembered a very different story rolling stone says their account would have been a red flag and all three say they would have talked if they d been called ryan duffin one of the trio said he felt deceived by jackie but he also pointed out that erdely s mistake in fact checking was about one single incident and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost had she gotten in direct contact with us it probably wouldn t have been printed at least in that way he said a lot of the article was still based in truth but the focal point would have been different it might have been less dramatic but it would have probably focused on some of the other uva students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus i think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that s not very common roderick said and i wonder if it would have been different if it dealt with someone with a less horrific story something that happens to more people i think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through now it s like if i wasn t assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention it s frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm before the report came out abraham axler the student body president said that some good had come from the article because it forced uva to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide but some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress i do feel like there s a possibility people will be afraid to come forward if you come forward and share your story if you don t have the date right every detail down you ll think i m going to be accused of being a liar it s easier for me to keep it to myself roderick said there are very serious and unresolved questions about the university s performance said steve coll dean of the columbia school of journalism rolling stone teed that subject up i wouldn t say that everything about rolling stone s treatment of that subject was perfect but it certainly doesn t fall under the same category as their reporting about jackie s narrative
change is coming to ferguson in the next few weeks the department of justice doj will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination it should not be forgotten that the doj review of the ferguson police department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of michael brown by a ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town s dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups now after a half year of unrest and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members change is beginning to come to ferguson the question is what kind of change the report from the department of justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens through illegal traffic stops and arrests and the use of excessive force the police department held town residents in bondage the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time court costs and fees constituted the second largest sources of revenue for the town rather than a force for public safety the ferguson police department became according to attorney general eric holder a collection agency one that preyed disproportionately on the town s african american residents the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers and evidence that african americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department but just a few weeks before the release of the report the ferguson police chief declared there were no racial issues in his department ferguson s ugly racist emails released the recommendations in the report ranging from new training and supervision of police officers addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system will if implemented remake the law enforcement system in the town a grand jury that investigated the shooting of brown by officer darren wilson chose not to file charges against him and the justice department also didn t find reason to prosecute without question change is coming to the town s government town manager john shaw ferguson s most powerful official and until the doj s blistering report the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city s deputy manager three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and on tuesday citizens elected two black candidates to the city council changing its racial composition five of six members and the mayor were white now the council will be black ferguson s hapless police chief thomas jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months long display of astonishing incompetence the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests the appointment of a commander from the state highway patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest jackson s departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council there will be a new police chief in ferguson but does that mean that fundamental change will come to ferguson not necessarily not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks the department of justice s full on negotiations with the leadership in ferguson will determine the shape of the new ferguson police department indeed the doj report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with st louis county many local activists have suggested just such a solution but given ongoing problems with policing in the county including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in ferguson last fall community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the doj can fold st louis county police into its monitoring and reform process equally important were the april general elections turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in ferguson with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than african americans but local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get out the vote campaigns the mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign although a petition for his recall has been circulating that means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the doj to remake the police department has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks community activists and residents must ensure that mayor james knowles plans to represent their vision of new ferguson police department but there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in ferguson and throughout st louis county ferguson s governing structure with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the united states that form of governance might have been precisely what thriving middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like st louis but working class suburbs like ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents may need a more robust form of governance in any case a system in which the elected officials have minimal power but non elected leaders like the town manager and the chief of police have inordinate power is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable non representative government that controlled ferguson s residents yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country likewise missouri like the vast majority of states holds municipal elections in non presidential election years guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout although only a few states hold the primary and general election in march and april as missouri law requires ferguson to do it s not that ferguson is so different than towns across america it s precisely because ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other jurisdictions in st louis county plagued by similar governance flaws including those towns led by african americans and ferguson s example should provoke self examination in working class suburbs across the country where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population change is coming to ferguson but the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical american town

durham north carolina cnn president obama s nomination of loretta lynch to become the country s first african american woman attorney general is a historic pick her confirmation however is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full senate drags into its sixth month the period between the senate judiciary committee s vote to confirm and the full senate vote which in lynch s case has not been scheduled has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history by the time the senate returns from easter recess on monday it ll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job combined lynch currently the u s attorney for the eastern district of new york cleared the committee february by a vote of with republican sens orrin hatch of utah lindsey graham of south carolina and jeff flake of arizona joining democrats in sending the nomination to the full senate obama nominated lynch to replace attorney general eric holder on november after holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier hundreds of miles from washington longtime residents of durham north carolina were beaming with pride lynch s family moved to the city when she was a child her parents married for years still live there they watched the announcement on television that was encouraging but i knew then that we had a fight on our hands said lynch s father the rev lorenzo lynch i ve been in politics most of my life i know that nothing is certain and i know that nothing is easy lorenzo lynch is a retired baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the s he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of durham in for the next round of his daughter s fight he traveled to washington in late january to attend his daughter s confirmation hearing before the judiciary committee i heard a lot at that hearing that i ve heard since childhood that is the presupposition of the mindset lorenzo lynch said the dual system or the dual treatment when asked to provide specific examples lorenzo lynch deferred to the state branch of the naacp and e lavonia allison a durham activist who has known loretta lynch since the family moved to durham i don t want to think about the epidermis but some people are thinking that way allison said suggesting that lynch s confirmation vote has been delayed because lynch is african american when it has taken so long when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated how else can we interpret that it is so different allison said in march rep g k butterfield d north carolina chairman of the congressional black caucus said i think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay but it s also the irrationality of the new republicans sen dick durbin d illinois evoked imagery of the segregated south in criticism of republicans saying lynch had been asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the senate calendar durbin was harshly criticized by arizona s sen john mccain i deeply regret that the senator from illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation mine and my republican colleagues mccain said on the senate floor it was offensive and unnecessary and i think he owes this body ms lynch and all americans an apology mccain added i thought he should be commended lorenzo lynch said i think that s a poetic description of what has happened and poetry like most language is limited but it does have wings to carry a point giuliani pushes for lynch confirmation senate republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on lynch s nomination is because she is african american many point out that lynch if confirmed will be replacing the country s first african american attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin instead republicans and democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle for some it s part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the senate for others the delay is retaliation for president obama s executive actions on immigration on the eve of holder s announcement of his plans to leave the department of justice the political number crunchers at fivethirtyeight com predicted that whoever the president nominated would likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the senate some of lynch s supporters across north carolina have organized to convince the state s two republican senators to support lynch s confirmation in march several dozen north carolina women led by the naacp traveled to washington to meet with their senators richard burr and thom tillis reportedly the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial at a news conference at the washington press club the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination senator burr and senator tillis it is time for you to act like you have some sense it s past time you have embarrassed the state of north carolina allison said after the meeting for their part burr and tillis released a statement after the meeting while we remain concerned with ms lynch s stated desire to lead the department of justice in the same manner as eric holder and will not be supporting her nomination we are grateful that the group came to washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas weeks later the naacp organized protests outside the senators offices in raleigh charlotte and wilmington i think there is a much deeper analysis said north carolina naacp branch president rev william barber ii i believe if she had been clarence thomas she would have been confirmed because of her courage her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land particularly the th and th amendments to the constitution and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement that is what they fear barber said obama turns up the heat on loretta lynch confirmation limbo lorenzo lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders he admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of african americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights now his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter s nomination and photos of his visit to the white house lynch admits that he s never told his only daughter that he s proud of her although he s sure she knows it he plans to change that soon regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination
are we alone in the cosmos or might there be intelligent life elsewhere last week nasa scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two this year is the th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun pegasi since then ground based surveys and nasa s kepler satellite have discovered nearly confirmed exoplanets and thousands more candidates await confirmation many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system some have large planets like jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than mercury the innermost planet in our solar system but smaller rocky planets like earth though harder to find appear to be even more abundant life on earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed that suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life life as we know it is carbon based and requires liquid water astronomers define the habitable zone around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet s surface any closer to the star the water will boil into vapor any farther and the water freezes into ice extrapolating from discoveries to date astronomers estimate there are perhaps billion earth like habitable zone planets in our milky way galaxy alone of course there is a difference between single celled organisms which developed billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so and mammals which appeared about million years ago and then the humans who have existed for only years intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than years old here on earth so while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse even assuming they evolved as humans did with ears and spoken language or eyes and written language is likely to be tiny and life that can use radio waves has existed on earth for only of the planet s history years out of billion if the half dozen or so rocky earth like exoplanets now known are similar the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as well winning your state lottery with one ticket of course if there are billion earth like planets out there the odds improve quite a bit if they all have histories like the earth s there might be planets in the milky way that could support communicative beings but before you start composing your first letter to an alien think about this the chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule another planet s years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago or it might happen a billion years in the future a lot depends on how long communication capabilities last civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet so the duration of the communication age on a planet could be short not to mention the average light travel time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years so unless humans evolve to be ageless we re not exchanging ims with aliens anytime soon if advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more the chances of communicating with them are not negligible but in that case they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are since they developed the capability far earlier than we did so if they wanted us to know they exist wouldn t they simply tell us the seti project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules the building blocks of life in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen rich atmosphere such as that created by the first bacteria on earth or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide nasa s james webb space telescope to be launched in will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky habitable exoplanets nasa s rovers have shown that mars was once much more habitable it had fresh water lakes and streams of water running along its surface some water still remains and there may yet be life discovered on mars new missions plan to look at europa and ganymede moons of jupiter that have liquid water below their icy surfaces life elsewhere in the universe and even elsewhere in our own milky way galaxy is practically inevitable signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes but the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years
it took prosecutors months to present witnesses to support their claim that former nfl star aaron hernandez killed semi pro player odin lloyd on monday hernandez s defense gave its side of the story wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day hernandez is on trial for the shooting death of lloyd whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june now that the defense has rested it won t be long before the jury begins deliberating much of the evidence in the former new england patriots case is circumstantial here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday as news spread that hernandez was under investigation in june patriots owner robert kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after lloyd s death he said he was not involved kraft testified last week he said he was innocent and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club there s only one potential problem with that claim the time lloyd was killed hadn t been made public yet by the time hernandez met with kraft so how could hernandez have known when lloyd was killed what a great great witness for the prosecution cnn legal analyst mel robbins said basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand when questioned by a defense attorney kraft said that he d never had any problems with hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him hernandez s fiancee shayanna jenkins revealed for the first time last week that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple s home that she said reeked of marijuana she also said she didn t know what was in the box that revelation may contradict the prosecution s contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered during cross examination by the defense jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled skunky earlier she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn t know what was in the box she said hernandez never told her and she never looked after concealing the box with her daughter s clothing jenkins said she threw it away in a random dumpster but could not remember exactly where much testimony has focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro lows about pairs of that shoe were made significantly fewer in a size the shoe s sole makes a distinct impression said lt steven bennett of the massachusetts state police the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes more than million make the same impression yet bennett who works in crime scene services testified that the footprint left near lloyd s body was in agreement or consistent with the air jordan retro lows size although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night he used an identical pair to make his determination bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints he introduced a march investigative report written by bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison prosecutors used grainy footage from hernandez s home security system to suggest he was holding a caliber handgun the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandez s home in my opinion the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol glock sales manager kyle aspinwall testified the video is time stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving hernandez s lawyers then showed a different part of the video time stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand suggesting it may be an ipad glock pistols don t have white glows to them do they defense attorney james sultan asked no they do not aspinwall answered sultan then displayed a soft pellet gun similar in shape to a glock suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding hernandez has pleaded not guilty in lloyd s death but already his arrest has led to deep consequences including his release from the new england patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings so what might make a young man who had signed a million contract risk everything prosecutors have said lloyd might have done or said something that didn t sit well with hernandez they claimed hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score hernandez s co defendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately but the case gets more complicated evidence collected in lloyd s death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub that double shooting took place in july almost a year before lloyd was killed prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing lloyd the spot where that double murder happened during trial prosecutors suggest a text written by hernandez the day before the murder saying he was buggin for showing lloyd the spot may have played a role in plotting to kill lloyd the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in lloyd s trial ruling it is prejudicial hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well but when the lloyd trial ends that murder trial awaits him cnn s jason hanna lawrence crook laura dolan and catherine e shoichet contributed to this report

recently a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook what exactly is service of process serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle if you are going to sue someone you should at least let them know about it sounds simple right in theory it is in practice it turns out people don t like being sued it also turns out that to many defendants procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense just as you may avoid bad news in life defendants tend to avoid process servers once a defendant has been served that means the judicial proceedings begin unfortunately that means defendants have an incentive to go off the grid although every state is different the law of service of process has evolved this way the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person and have some proof that the person was the defendant in person service is not always possible for obvious reasons so the law had to develop methods of alternate service but carefully balance a defendant s right to have notice of a lawsuit against a diligent plaintiff s access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable as reliable as the u s mail is regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers not because the postmen can t be trusted they can neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will keep them from delivering those papers instead it s defendants no wait all of humanity that can t be trusted every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn t get it defendants are no different one form of alternate service is nail and mail service this means that you take a hammer and nail and nail the papers to the defendant s front door the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at doesn t mean he ll be back there anytime soon another even odder form of service is service by publication this is an almost laughable legal fiction if you can t find a defendant a judge might let you serve by publication that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the secaucus law journal looking for lawsuits against you as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds it s at least more rational than this antiquated method at first blush the idea of service by facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him when it comes to serving papers however traditional doesn t necessarily mean good service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable it s just service of last resort for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a facebook announcement in a news feed along with the photos of dinner or kittens to be liked by all your gawking friends we re not quite there yet while the older forms of alternate service were public most electronic service takes the form of email where email isn t available it is facebook private messaging which should be as private as email that s the form of service authorized by the court here so for now we re not quite putting lawsuits on instagram but i wouldn t rule it out in the future online service may be a new frontier but it s not unheard of most of us exist more online now than we live in a particular condo or mom s basement virtually everyone has a phone or access to the internet not everyone has a lease or a mortgage plus online service has the added benefit of tracking believe me somewhere some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article how long you read it and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article thanks for still being here by the way in a way maybe online service is long overdue you can outrun a process server for a while but sooner or later all of us have to go back online and no human can outrun an email

london cnn it wasn t messrs clooney pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a london vault during the easter weekend but last weekend s raid in the heart of the city s jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like ocean given its daring and planning such robberies are rare the gang didn t follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than years in september the staff of a bank in baker street central london arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a yard tunnel from a shop they had rented hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room the gang got away with a haul worth around million the incident later formed the basis of the movie the bank job but how are such heists organized roy ramm a former commander of specialist operations at london s scotland yard for years explains in the uk burglaries and robberies are often committed by working class people people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs in more than years as a scotland yard detective i never met a raffles or a thomas crown style criminal from a middle class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime sophisticated heists like the hatton garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break ins many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar occasionally they steal things they can t sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly more specialist criminals those for example who target museums or country houses will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high iqs with a kind of raw street intelligence one of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself possibly from a source of inside information probably the biggest difference between any heist you ll see in a movie and its real life equivalent is the motive i ve never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done the only reason has been for the money often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime the brinks mat robbery in a case which i was involved in at the time saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than million around million or million adjusting for inflation from a warehouse at london s heathrow airport the knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale london neighbourhood the true amount will never be known both were made possible by inside information it s an angle that london detectives investigating last weekend s heist will be looking at very closely the planning behind the hatton garden raid will have been meticulous the target will have been observed perhaps for months and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime a long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available also perhaps when regular staff are away sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job usually they will already be known directly to each other perhaps because they worked on other jobs together possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding so gangs in the uk tend to come from the same social and ethnic group maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area even though there is more diversity in society it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime vehicles will have been obtained stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed equipment will have been sourced everything will have been cleaned cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces they will plan routes that avoid cctv and timings that attract the least attention they will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems they will have planned their getaway their clean up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime what criminals steal doesn t vary that much cash is probably first choice followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash like gold jewellery and watches the conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive the brinks mat bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals unless they are stealing to order because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller a painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector london detectives investigating the hatton garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement but police enquiries won t stop there they will look at every aspect of how the target business operates then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited the forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense in recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the dna of a criminal cctv footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross checked rewards for information will be offered witnesses will interviewed in the police s criminal intelligence branch the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources informers will be tasked to report what they hear the details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets both in the uk and internationally the detectives investigating these major crimes in the uk see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism they don t admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber but the investigation will still be relentless
fans of the late actor paul walker knew that watching him in furious would be bittersweet even so many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film which earned a record million over the weekend still packed an emotional wallop not gonna lie i shed a few tears at the end of furious the tribute to paul walker was very well done one woman said monday on twitter hers was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring walker who died at in a car crash in november before filming on furious was completed to finish walker s scenes the makers of the movie used body doubles computer generated images and even the actor s brothers but it was the ending that really got to moviegoers in finishing furious the film s producers sought to retire walker s character brian while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster furious action franchise but they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative if they had gone down the other path i think i would have refused to finish making this movie director james wan told buzzfeed instead the movie s makers chose to retire paul s character in the most sincere and elegant way they could wan said their idea was to have brian retire from his dangerous high octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend mia who is pregnant with their second child a scene late in the movie shows him and mia playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on essentially saying goodbye then his longtime buddy dom reminisces about their years together leading to a montage of walker scenes from the first six movies the song that plays over the montage is see you again a collaboration between wiz khalifa and charlie puth co star vin diesel shared the video for the song late sunday on his facebook page where it has more than million likes fans on twitter and facebook mostly praised the movie s ending as a fitting tribute and an emotionally wrenching one man i don t care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater i saw it times in one day the ending is the deepest ending i ve ever seen one man wrote on the movie s facebook page

havana cuba cnn all eyes are going to be on the new kid finally allowed to play and the big kid who for so long wanted nothing to do with him cuba and the united states in the same diplomatic playground cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by marshaling the support of other regional countries to insist on their attendance at the summit of the americas and for the first time since the u s has not blocked cuba s attempt to join now it s time to see how they play and who they play with especially venezuela which often falls out with washington for crushing dissent at home and supplying havana with billions of dollars in oil cuba is trying to re establish itself at the two day summit in panama arriving with more than government officials diplomats small business people and artists but cuba s attempts to rebrand itself as an open diverse society stumbled wednesday when government supporters and anti castro supporters brawled in the streets of panama video of the incident showed cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee with the historic thawing in relations between the u s and cuba washington now has urgent business to discuss with havana we have really big issues with the cubans that do need to be solved said ambassador vicki huddleston who served as the chief of the u s interests section in havana she added the cubans are typical of their negotiating style you think it s going to be easy because we have said we are going to have good relations with you and they say that s not exciting for us and it is for you so they are hard negotiators as they always have been the forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re establish formal relations and re open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations while president barack obama is not scheduled to meet cuban leader raul castro u s officials said there will be opportunities for interaction between the two leaders the first time the two heads of state met was in at nelson mandela s funeral their brief handshake captured the world s attention and lit up social media few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked cold war era relations obama had said he had hoped a u s embassy would reopen in havana before the summit but cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until cuba is removed from the u s state department list of countries that support terrorism it would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism said josefina vidal the general director of u s affairs at the cuban foreign ministry and lead negotiator in the talks cuba was added to the list in which includes syria iran and sudan the designation carries financial sanctions which cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy the state department has sent a recommendation to the white house that cuba be removed paving the way for the white house to announce its intent to de list cuba as early as this week two administration officials told cnn removal from the list does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system or its foreign policy deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said on a conference call with reporters tuesday it s a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on venezuela saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the united states despite a recent declaration to that effect the designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt venezuelan officials but it ignited a firestorm particularly in cuba which has close ties to venezuela deceased venezuelan president hugo chavez was a friend and admirer of former cuban leader fidel castro chavez s successor nicolas maduro continues to send cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day despite his country s own economic turmoil in exchange cuba sends doctors military advisers and sports trainers to venezuela in cuba s state run media criticism of u s policy towards venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in u s cuba relations in march fidel castro published a letter criticizing the u s brutal plans towards venezuela and the cuban government promised unconditional aid to help defend against american threats its remains to be seen how much cuba will risk its warming relations with the united states to back up ally venezuela but apparently there is little doubt among the cuban people on what their government should do a poll of cubans released on wednesday found that of the people surveyed by miami based polling firm bendixen amandi on behalf of the washington post and univision noticias fusion supported improved u s cuban relations

washington cnn president barack obama says he is absolutely committed to making sure israel maintains a military advantage over iran his comments to the new york times published on sunday come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the united states and five other world powers struck with iran tehran agreed to halt the country s nuclear ambitions and in exchange western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran s economy obama said he understands and respects netanyahu s stance that israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn t have the luxury of testing these propositions in the deal but what i would say to them is that not only am i absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge and that they can deter any potential future attacks but what i m willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood including iran a clarity that if israel were to be attacked by any state that we would stand by them obama said that he said should be sufficient to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table he said the framework negotiators announced last week would see iran reduce its centrifuges from to limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections the talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until june but netanyahu and republican critics in congress have complained that iran won t have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country s leadership isn t trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as obama says they are obama said even if iran can t be trusted there s still a case to be made for the deal in fact you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they re doing and that for a long period of time we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon obama said
there s an old saying which states the cape verde islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world in truth such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove but there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend the important and proud relationship the atlantic island country of just people has with music situated roughly miles off the west coast of africa cape verde has long been a mesh of cultures history and races the former portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade a target for th century pirates and a refuge for exiled jews from this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque morna funana and other distinct musical styles now cape verde is seeking to tap into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish bereft of oil gas gold diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other african countries cape verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development and what s more alternative than a jiving swinging musical economy besides fish it is pretty common for cape verde to say our biggest richness is in music and culture said christine semba of womex an international networking platform for the world music genre the economic potential of music has been also acknowledged by cape verde s prime minister jose maria neves while the country s ministry of culture is run by mario lucio de sousa himself a popular musician the future of our country lies in our capacity to create our capacity to innovate neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a world trade organization conference in other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts fashion and visual arts to name but a few however a report from the un conference on trade and development noted that cape verde s creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning but that doesn t mean there hasn t been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future one early musical success has been the kriol jazz festival the event which is celebrating its seventh edition took place in the capital city of praia this past weekend artists including grammy winning u s singer esperanza spalding have been invited to perform as have acts from the likes of luxembourg brazil and of course cape verde according to harold taveres a liaison to the mayor of praia involved with promoting the festival kjf has become one of the most spectacular events in cape verde we breathe the music in cape verde we live with the music he added now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world to share in this during the festival bars hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as the week of party it s a lucrative trade for sure yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country s ministry of culture alongside some enterprising private sector figures thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required enter the atlantic music expo a three year old conference and networking event that seeks to help cape verdean artists secure international exposure this year s ame took place in the days before the kriol jazz festival delegates local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business we try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from cape verde said jose da silva long time manager of the late cape verdean songstress cesaria evora da silva is one of the driving forces behind ame as well as being the founder of the lusafrica and harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from cape verde he hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top level musicians they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of cape verde across the globe not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require but it will garner valuable attention for the country this is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie tourism is expected to account for of the country s gdp by according to research from the world travel and tourism council getting cape verde s name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important economically it s beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big da silva said this way it costs less money semba agrees with this and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like da silva for special praise in the long term the whole country is behind this event semba said adding this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries it must be noted however that few countries have the same natural resources for music as cape verde more from marketplace africa
hamlet romeo and juliet a midsummer night s dream for centuries these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history s most heralded literary canon but now they may have to make room for an addition to shakespeare s famous oeuvre new research indicates that double falsehood a play first published in by lewis theobald was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the newer play the match between the double falsehood play and shakespeare was a landslide it was shockingly clear said ryan l boyd a researcher at the university of texas at austin the study co authored by boyd and ut colleague james w pennebaker was published in the journal psychological science there s very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed plays by shakespeare nine by fletcher and by theobald to create a psychological signature of each author based on word choices phrase patterns and other factors they compared those profiles to the language in double falsehood and determined that the play s first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher only tiny traces of theobald s signature were found we re certainly not suggesting that theobald didn t make edits boyd told cnn but he clearly did not write it double falsehood also known as the distressed lovers is based on the cardenio section of don quixote the classic th century novel by miguel de cervantes set in spain the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers one virtuous one sinful theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered all of them written by shakespeare but many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake suspecting that theobald tried to pass the bard s work off as his own shakespeare who died in wrote most of his published plays between and british publishers arden shakespeare published double falsehood in for the first time in years amid renewed claims by experts that it was shakespeare s work but the new study by boyd and pennebaker the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective may settle the matter once and for all shakespearean scholar brean hammond professor of modern english literature at nottingham university in the uk praised the texas study for its scientific approach hammond said boyd and pennebaker have got no dogs in the fight they re not literary scholars so their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies hammond studied double falsehood s authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found shakespeare s dna evident in the play but he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest those people who don t believe the play was written by shakespeare aren t going to just lay down and die he said

last month wu rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on international women s day against sexual harassment in china since then the chinese authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for creating disturbances they also briefly detained some of the activists supporters raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment lawyers and adequate rest the fate of the five will be revealed by april as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or formally arrested which almost always leads to conviction in china s legal system the timing of the detentions of china s most inventive women s rights activists is ironic not only did they take place on the very day that marks women s achievements and their struggle for equality but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women s rights it appears poised to adopt its first and long awaited anti domestic violence law which is expected to get a reading before the national people s congress standing committee this summer this year also marks the th anniversary of the influential fourth world conference on women hosted in beijing during which hillary clinton famously declared that women s rights are human rights i first met wu at a conference several years ago at a time when there were very few women in china s weiquan or rights defense movement it was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as babes or little sisters even in professional and ostensibly progressive settings as women s rights activists wu and others fight on two fronts against overt rights violations by the chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second class citizens by the time we met again two years later wu and her young direct action feminist colleagues were clearly off and running they staged small public performance art protests that attracted media headlines energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women s rights movement and pushed women s rights into the national consciousness and onto the government s agenda wu had an upbringing typical of her times she comes from the countryside which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes in recent decades the economy has soared but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth pollution unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor like many parents she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter safer upbringing many in wu and her colleagues generation are clear eyed about the problems of china s development model and some want to address those wu joined yirenping a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities and later founded the women s rights organization hangzhou women center and it is in yirenping that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern china wu and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor occupying public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women donning blood spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate especially with young women in the country perhaps this is what the government finds threatening that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times they are young confident ready to challenge established norms and most importantly they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it as china prepares to mark the anniversary of the fourth world conference on women in september it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists but even if they are released their work promoting women s rights will have become exponentially more difficult the women will now be labeled sensitive individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments known as color revolutions and foreign funding of civil society organizations what wu and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists and imprisoned others but they have also tried to co opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable so long as they abandon their activism this kind of differentiated management of nongovernmental organizations punishing some but co opting others may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups but ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make wu and her friends campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through authoritarian activism alone the chinese communist party now faces a dizzying array of challenges not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations rather than lengthening its list of challenges the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like wu and her colleagues rather than treating them as criminals
malala yousafzai s stellar career has included a nobel peace prize last week she made it into outer space a nasa astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from pakistan who was gravely wounded by a pakistani taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls to go to school it took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago but malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause after reading her story scientist amy mainzer who also consults for pbs on a children s educational science show decided malala deserved to be immortalized so she attached her name to the heavens thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between mars and jupiter mainzer working at the jet propulsion laboratory discovered asteroid in june which gave her the right to name it my postdoctoral fellow dr carrie nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named very few have been named to honor the contributions of women and particularly women of color mainzer wrote in a note to malala mainzer gave it the name malala or ml malala s asteroid circles the sun between mars and jupiter every five and half years mainzer said it is about kilometers in diameter and its surface is very dark the color of printer toner as a scientist her support for malala s work is logical when girls around the world also get educations it increases human potential we desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity s most difficult problems and we can t afford to reject half the population s mainzer wrote
emy afalava is a loyal american and decorated veteran he was born in american samoa a u s territory since he has been subject to american law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen the constitution would agree the fourteenth amendment declares that all persons born in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states yet afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen how can it be in the st century that americans born on u s soil are denied the rights of citizenship that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the th anniversary of the decision of american samoa to join the united states it is a wrong that afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d c circuit a decision could come any day since the united states was established it adhered to the rule that those born on u s lands were u s citizens the rule is colorblind yet the only exception that the supreme court has ever declared was not the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african americans had no rights that the white man was bound to respect though they were americans they were not citizens under the constitution a civil war later the th amendment reversed the ruling in the dred scott case today the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court but racial discrimination didn t end there in a puerto rican woman named isabel gonzalez sailed for new york because puerto rico was u s territory she believed herself to be a u s citizen but officials at ellis island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland she sued with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling yet the supreme court that eventually heard gonzalez s case was still racist in preceding years for example it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the chinese race and in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second class u s territories justice edward douglas white s opinion stated that u s sovereignty extended over them but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other americans he did so he privately revealed because he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions in the gonzalez case the justices agreed unanimously that puerto ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws but they declined to decide whether or not gonzalez was a citizen though preoccupied by fears that islanders were savages and racially unfit for citizenship they were unwilling to violate the constitution as a result of the court ruling federal officials were able to deny gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years as isabel gonzalez s lawyer told the court declaring that residents of america s island territories are not u s citizens would mean adding to precedents in our history of which we are least proud those precedents he warned the court had been repudiated by the american people in the civil war by three amendments to the constitution of the united states by this court and by advancing civilization surely years after the dred scott case was overturned the time has come to put an end to this farce in the past century the inhabitants of every other u s island territory have become citizens today emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last americans still waiting to become citizens

no prostitutes no ifs ands or buts and yes that includes when and where prostitution is perfectly legal that was the message friday from attorney general eric holder to members of the u s justice department which includes the fbi u s marshals service bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives and other agencies the solicitation of prostitution threatens the core mission of the department holder wrote in a memo to all personnel in the department he heads regardless of whether prostitution is legal or tolerated in a particular jurisdiction soliciting prostitutes creates a greater demand for human trafficking and a consequent increase in the number of minor and adult persons trafficked into commercial sex slavery holder doesn t mention specific cases of federal agents and prostitution in his memo nor is he dictating a new policy the attorney general said only that he wanted to reiterate to all department personnel including attorneys and law enforcement officers that they are prohibited from soliciting procuring or accepting commercial sex agents behaving badly overseas the directive comes a few weeks after a justice department inspector general report found dea agents in foreign postings attended sex parties with prostitutes paid for by drug cartels among other indiscretions that report by department inspector general michael horowitz cited light punishments and poor handling of sexual misconduct cases at dea and other justice department agencies justice department employees don t have a monopoly on such stories in a group of agents and officers in the secret service which is part of the department of homeland security and officers sent to colombia ahead of president barack obama were relieved of duty and returned home amid allegations of misconduct that involved prostitution that prostitute visit was arranged for by a dea agent stationed in colombia according to horowitz s office if someone from the atf fbi federal bureau of prisons or a federal prosecutor is caught with a prostitute they ll be suspended or fired according to holder s memo this rule applies at all times during an individual s employment including while off duty or on personal leave
recently nashville s district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals believe it or not nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years there has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in america in would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal except it happens all the time some have claimed this practice evokes a dark corner of american history where the mentally ill or deficient were forced to undergo sterilization yeah that s true we did that and it was bad except this isn t quite that female sterilization is linked to the controversial eugenics movement which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes there is even a supreme court case buck v bell in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and imbeciles for the protection and health of the state was constitutional the opinion in the case is stunning especially because the supreme court has never technically overruled it but buck v bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities not because they were being punished for a crime you can hate sterilization and the tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics but it s not that present day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment others may argue that the supreme court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment and struck it down that s true too sort of in skinner v oklahoma the court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional but not because it was cruel and unusual instead the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes so the question remains is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional the eighth amendment provides excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted practically however punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary we have executed people with hangings and by firing squad sterilization has to be somewhere below that right ultimately however the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the constitution it is permissible if you willingly choose it suppose arguendo for argument s sake that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment violating the eighth amendment this is where it gets interesting it still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal shocked you shouldn t be as citizens we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time you waive your fourth amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer yes to an officer s mind if i look in your trunk you waive your fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle s trunk so then if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights can we waive our eighth amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional and are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals nope sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure if sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional and we ve been doing it for a while then that begs the question why the outrage now why the story that a tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced there are really only two possibilities first some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news second even if we knew about it we didn t mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference most of the sterilization defendants are men search your feelings luke when we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters the idea of castration as punishment doesn t sound so bad right be honest let go of your we re all equal in all ways banner for a moment after all not too long ago execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions so if we re ok with the gas chamber we re probably ok with a snip it s ok you can admit it we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias whether we like it or not still not convinced watch this parlor trick what if i suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor so far you re not ruling it out and what if it s a young female high school teacher having sex with her year old student most of our gut feelings shifted from maybe to no just now it s ok to admit that too of course sterilization won t prevent a female sex offender from offending again no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again but the point is somehow the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal maybe it s that on a primal unconscious level what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man even if you re offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a shocking news story you must concede it fits why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty of course we have to consider the related justification overall a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women just ask any domestic violence prosecutor are sterilization plea deals morally right it s hard to say for now they appear to be constitutional but controversial if we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child should the government step in if so to what degree fortunately we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now just keep neutering the men
after two days of deliberation jurors found dzhokhar tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the boston marathon bombing the verdict isn t surprising what might be however is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again because there could be other more young men just like him which means the lessons we take from boston will affect whether we can keep america and americans safer today nearly out of people in the world are muslim by pew reports that will be some out of by well i ll quote the all caps headline reprinted by the drudge report muslims to outnumber christians many americans read such numbers and worry will this mean more dzhokhar tsarnaevs but that s only if you believe islam causes extremism which many have argued and that s wrong of course on the other hand there are people who claim islam has nothing to do with terrorism which is true and false sure the islamic faith forbids murder but there s a small but significant minority of muslims murdering people in terrible ways and in islam s name understanding what leads young muslims like dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization at any given moment in the middle east we have little idea who s going to attack whom next who s on whom s side how this is going to end or what anyone s even fighting over anymore this bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better but it will get better to understand why we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes muslims contrary to common belief muslims aren t unusually predisposed to violence radical islam which has taken on an ugly life of its own began at the intersection of politics religion and religious identity islam is about what you believe but it s also about being part of a community and what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack some muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions the road to hell after all consider the tragedy of modern islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies before my time the brutal soviet invasion of afghanistan horrified many muslims when i was in high school bosnia occupied all our attention there was of course russia s brutal war on the chechen people dzhokhar shares his name with a recent chechen patriot and israel s ongoing occupation of the palestinian territories and the blows against muslims don t end there there was serbia s war on kosovo another war in chechnya the invasion of iraq oppression in myanmar civil strife in syria the colonization of east turkestan massacres of muslims in the central african republic wars on a besieged gaza and west bank still under israeli rule imagine how this looks to a restless young muslim countless places where co religionists have been killed and nobody seems to do anything about it nobody even wants to extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening and then moved quickly to a single tempting terrible response take up arms and kill in her new book heretic why islam needs a reformation now ayaan hirsi ali argues that extremism isn t caused by political circumstances but by islam itself her conclusion is wrong to fight extremism we don t need to reform islam we need to show young muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to rather than help muslims it s harming them when i was a teenager our massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from bosnia that shared graphic heartbreaking stories of rape exile and massacre inflicted on muslims all because of their faith the mosque raised money collected food blankets medicine promises were made to provide more and regularly but we all knew that wasn t enough as we left the mosque my peers and i were disgruntled and confused shocked angry our teachers could ve told us go and fight defend your muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege or they could ve told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably neither answer would have satisfied fortunately for us they offered us a third way they showed us patiently how to work with others how to compromise how to get things done a more engaged american muslim community they explained could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world they were right we saw the dead end road of radicalism from afar but we also saw up close how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless ineffectual and ignored thanks to social media a medium that the world s burgeoning young muslim population is increasingly comfortable with more muslims can and will see this too radicalism will be done in by fellow muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it it s happening already our national conversation about islam is focused on the wrong issues does islam need a reformation what in islam causes violence we would do a lot better if we accepted that muslims the world over have real grievances dictatorships corruption foreign intervention religious illiteracy lack of economic opportunity and radicals exploit these we need to show the young dzhokhars that if they want to help then violence isn t going to help to fight extremism we need to pose this question to young muslims do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse their narrative has failed their solution is bankrupt the caliph wears no clothes it s the reason why increasing numbers of muslims reject extremism and not just because our numbers are increasing
it s a good thing a lucky thing that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer michael slager gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named walter scott after a traffic stop in north charleston south carolina and the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation along with the prompt arrest of slager on murder charges is a welcome and appropriate response but the event raises broad troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a third party recording it s not supposed to be a mystery more than years ago congress approved a law the violent crime control and law enforcement act of signed by president bill clinton that requires the federal justice department to collect data on deaths caused by police the law has never truly been implemented leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in america what happened here today doesn t happen all the time what if there was no video what if there was no witness or hero as i call him to come forward said l chris stewart an attorney for scott s family as you can see the initial police reports stated something totally different that s putting it mildly in early police statements issued before the video came to light slager reportedly said that scott attacked him that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive scott the video makes hash of those claims and likely contributed to slager s swift arrest and pending murder charges when you re wrong you re wrong said north charleston mayor keith summey that leaves slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality i m all for having police use body cameras although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force but the much bigger problem is that we simply don t know when and where police killings take place or whether they cluster in particular cities or states and that means we don t know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias we don t even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness these vital questions aren t supposed to be a mystery according to section of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of the attorney general shall through appropriate means acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers the attorney general shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section that section of the law has effectively been ignored beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in by a new york times article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force no comprehensive accounting for all of the nation s police department exists there are multiple reasons the law has been ignored collecting information from the nation s thousands of jurisdictions the myriad villages counties and cities is a tough expensive assignment the job is even harder because many police departments reluctant to air their dirty laundry fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it s up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality something that s often established only after years of court proceedings these hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from washington but congress has failed to press the justice department to demand the data and comply with the law a weak substitute called the death in custody reporting act was passed in and renewed in but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular mandatory enforcement of the data gathering law in the las vegas review journal published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around las vegas and found shootings over a year period of which were fatal in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on duty shooting in south carolina last month the state newspaper published an examination of instances in which officers shot at suspects and found that only a handful of officers were charged and none found guilty in south carolina it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone the columbia newspaper concluded a group of activists has created a website called mappingpoliceviolence org that flags cases of police killings its estimate that at least black people were killed by police in may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem but we shouldn t be guessing as the las vegas review journal editorialized in how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings how can they know about a potential local problem without information police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute the budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule the social impact of such an addition however would be huge that common sense observation is being echoed by the obama administration specifically the president s task force on st century policing created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including michael brown and eric garner the recently released interim report of the task force calls one more time for the justice department to collect comprehensive data from local departments but it will take more pressure from activists victims families members of congress and president barack obama himself to demand an end to the stonewalling of information it s long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like walter scott s are happening without a video to set the record straight
the new emojis are here on thursday apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won t cut it the reaction to this new lineup is as should be expected with almost anything new in today s hypersensitive climate a range of cheers and jeers why is any of this important you may ask for many these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity sexual orientation race or even hair color is part of mainstream america despite what others might say this matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens if not hundreds of times every day think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling or more accurately think of a white face smiling because up until thursday s update all the emojis had pale skin but that has all changed now there s a range of emoji skin tones to pick from including yellow brown and black i m sure few people will be upset with this development but how about in december why now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji and that will also include santa claus that shrieking sound you may have heard was from fox news megyn kelly who famously stated in that santa claus is absolutely definitely and without a doubt a white guy in fact thanks to apple we may even see brown santa emojis this december could that mean he s a muslim santa cue even more shrieking from fox news there is more apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis kissing with a heart over their heads this inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on twitter it s not yet clear if a person who likes to use same sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of religious liberty but it would be interesting to hear what any of the gop presidential candidates might have to say about gay emojis and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay the fact is when you embrace diversity you will still leave out other minority groups redheads for example are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color in fact supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures even expanding the flags represented by emojis as apple has done comes at some peril apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it but armenians are not happy they were left out i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage it s heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji armenia i feel your pain of course the bigger question in the whole diverse emoji issue is what took apple so long how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from that the company finally did is a step in the right direction america s demographics are changing so our representations of who we are even representations as tiny as emojis should reflect this apple has evolved in showing diversity from brown people to same sex couples maybe religious liberty conservatives who discriminate will follow
hillary clinton finally answered the question we ve all been asking for years will she run for president in with official news of her candidacy just hours old one thing is already crystal clear for the next year and a half clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the united states win or lose this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder just consider the two potential outcomes a win would mean a woman in the white house which is a vital step in the march toward women s full political inclusion but it s possible that the march will end right there we ll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we ve come we ll raise the mission accomplished banner over the women s movement and we ll call it a day granted of elected officials throughout the country will still be men women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office and pay inequities sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve no matter how hard clinton might try but we ve elected a woman as president we ll say let her take care of it a loss would be even more difficult clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is more generally her loss would perpetuate the myth that women cannot win big elections that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination and that women must be twice as good to get half as far if hillary clinton can t win an election potential female candidates will ask how can i extrapolating from one female candidate s experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect but in the case of clinton it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons first clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate if there is such a thing she began the race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve and she is even more well known today but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with years of public accomplishments and years of well publicized baggage voters donors journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in iowa steps onto a debate stage in new hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in kentucky too often we treat clinton s loss to barack obama in the democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power in reality what people knew about hillary clinton likely shaped their views of hillary clinton widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not after all for decades women who have run for office have performed just as well as men they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money do some voters still question women s suitability as leaders of course they do but these attitudes which have become increasingly rare do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates second presidential politics is first and foremost a partisan affair the d or r in front of the candidates names not the x or y chromosomes in their dna tells us about how more than of the population will vote party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case now i ll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes photos and captions that have taken hold on social media the clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes i don t want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate disrespectful and appalling and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates won t need to consider but men yelling iron my shirt at a campaign rally cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know if clinton wins the race it will be because it was a good year for democrats and if she loses it will be because the gop developed a winning message but how much does any of this really matter sure voters are amenable to electing women any democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the white house and inferring too much from hillary clinton s experiences is a risky endeavor yet the minute clinton announced her candidacy she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the united states that s a label that no female candidate should have to wear let the burden begin

london cnn the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back of iraqi territory seized by isis the map above shows gains in key central and northern areas of iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force the gains made in the fight against the terror group by iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive although as the u s department of defense acknowledges it s a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on daily fluctuations in the battle lines so how exactly should we read this information what does it say about the wider fight against isis cnn asked afzal ashraf a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq below is an edited version of the conversation cnn so is the tide turning in iraq is the coalition winning afzal ashraf when it comes to insurgencies it s always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them there have been significant gains against isis particularly in tikrit and it s no coincidence we ve seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in syria it s asymmetric warfare they know they cannot hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw then take initiative elsewhere they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere it continues their image of initiative of shocking of reshaping the world which is what they are trying to do cnn what does the map tell us about the coalition s strategy aa it s very telling there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraqi forces it s a push against the front line of isis rather than being brave and creative and going in behind isis s lines and breaking it up what this isn t is using maneuverist warfare which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push the capability you need for this kind of warfare is much more high tech than the capabilities the iraqis have those capabilities are available in the region jordanians egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft and it s very interesting that the middle eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target isis which is an existential threat cnn what about ramadi isis seems to be winning there aa ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade but in this context isis will be pushing in ramadi because that s an area they have lots of support it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains the concept of success is hugely important to them it s what sustains the recruitment effort of isis nobody wants to join a bunch of losers so it s very important for them to be seen to be succeeding above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in nimrud and killing refugees in camps like yarmouk but where it counts they are not standing and fighting
arsenal kept their slim hopes of winning this season s english premier league title alive by beating relegation threatened burnley at turf moor a first half goal from welsh international aaron ramsey was enough to separate the two sides and secure arsenal s hold on second place more importantly it took the north london club to within four points of first placed chelsea with the two clubs to play next week but chelsea have two games in hand and play lowly queens park rangers on sunday a team who are themselves struggling against relegation good form arsenal have been in superb form since the start of the year transforming what looked to be another mediocre season struggling to secure fourth place and with it champions league qualification into one where they at least have a shot at winning the title after going ahead arsenal rarely looked in any danger of conceding showing more of the midfield pragmatism epitomized by the likes of francis coquelin who also played a crucial role in the goal he has been absolutely consistent in the quality of his defensive work arsenal coach arsene wenger told sky sports after the game when asked about coquelin s contribution to arsenal s current run they have won eight games in a row since introducing the previously overlooked young frenchman into a more defensive midfield position he was a player who was with us for seven years from he s now just wenger explained sometimes you have to be patient i am very happy for him because he has shown great mental strength now all eyes will be on next week s clash between arsenal and chelsea which will likely decide the title they have the games in hand said wenger playing down his club s title aspirations but we ll keep going and that s why the win was so important for us today relegation dogfight meanwhile it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league aston villa continued their good form since appointing coach tim sherwood with a victory over tottenham who fired sherwood last season belgian international christian benteke scored the only goal of the game his eighth in six matches to secure a vital three points to give the midlands club breathing space another midlands club looking over their shoulder is west brom who conceded an injury time goal to lose against bottom club leicester city but it was an awful day for sunderland s former dutch international coach dick advocaat who saw his team lose at home against form team crystal palace democratic republic of congo international yannick bolasie scored crystal palace s first ever hat trick in the premier league to secure an easy victory
i m haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police his back turned to the officer what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen scott and allows him to die face down in the dirt while slager appears to plant an item next to his body i understand why people are skeptical of self defense claims especially from law enforcement if not for the video taken by a bystander i can t help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation as a defense attorney i am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime but this single piece of evidence a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat defies any reasonable explanation thank god there was a camera it will help ensure that justice will be served in this case however there is another camera that had it been deployed might have prevented the entire tragedy a police body camera throughout the entire encounter with scott it s clear slager had no idea someone was filming him had he known there would be video of his every move would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man would he have fired eight times would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report of course not if slager had been wearing a body camera scott would probably still be alive and slager wouldn t be facing the possibility of life in prison or a possible death sentence body cameras are expensive to deploy sure and storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more that cost however if we re talking the monetary kind may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to scott s family in an inevitable civil suit against the north charleston police department most importantly we have to ask ourselves this what s the value of a human life certainly it s worth the price of some mass data storage and there s something else at stake the public is losing confidence in law enforcement and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street as fear ratchets up so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve as tension rises the risk of more shootings increases it is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos police body cameras can help break this cycle studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera complaints against cops decrease and most importantly use of force incidents drop i will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution they only help compensate for the real underlying problem which is this there is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men when we look at this footage and when we see the dashboard camera from the other south carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver s license it s clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions even routine actions from black men as potentially aggressive these may not be overtly racist cops they may not intentionally treat black men differently but we can t pretend that black men aren t being disproportionately targeted all across the country we see it happening and with the proliferation of video we re seeing it happen with alarming frequency somehow we re going to have to beat this bias out of our system set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it as a society we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income education and opportunities disparities that keep us a racially divided nation but social change sadly may take generations of hard work in the meantime if we can t immediately root out racial bias we can at least put a bright spotlight on it and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life we can start by placing body mounted cameras on cops
danny kahneman my good friend and co author who got a nobel prize in economics once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure the other group which experienced the same type of colonoscopy did not it turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning the psychology of it is simple to understand happy endings matter even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well so too with taxes let s just say that when it comes to taxes for the average american stuff happens keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running paycheck to tax reduced paycheck but recent statistics suggest that out of american taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes and the average amount is close to that pays for a lot of stuff to make the good news even better tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free no filing headaches and a check to boot what s not to like the fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the u s tax system for example the laws are biased against two worker marriages taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich who make their wealth off of their existing wealth the largely untaxed returns from capital rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us but now is not the time to explain such serious matters the people are too busy spending their refunds the once dreaded tax day has become a happy spending spree for most americans this state of short term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws in brief the u s income tax system is increasingly a wage tax with limited taxes on capital what the rich have and limited deductions for most of us for example out of americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions all of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians professors and pundits but who has time for that let s go to our television sets and check out the commercials one clever spot ran during the recent super bowl suggesting that the boston tea party a tax revolt could have been averted with free online filing which the sponsor was eager to provide filling out s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time who doesn t remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in april the cruelest month now as tax day approaches we are flooded with advertisements about america getting its billions back without even having to pay to prepare the forms we get paid to play here is the happy ending that kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past the simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled americans of course these kind souls want their happy endings too they are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers the grateful taxpayers turned consumers will happily purchase add on services such as audit protection insurance or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees the found money of tax returns can finance many nice purchases of course there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws biased against modern families and wage earners and in favor of the rich living off capital no real bother stuff happens let others fret about fairness as long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile or a check who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before
even in the horror of syria s civil war there are few places that showcase the scale of the destruction and the senselessness of the loss of life more than the yarmouk camp on the outskirts of damascus set up as a refugee camp for palestinians in the s it slowly evolved into a neighborhood over the years but since it has been engulfed in the syrian conflict two weeks ago isis fighters stormed yarmouk and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before the syrian government responded by unleashing a bombing and shelling campaign on the area residents told cnn including barrel bombs that flattened many of the buildings already scarred by the three year long conflict death comes day and night i looked up and saw dust one resident said i opened the door and started walking outside and started shouting to the neighbors one told me i am wounded another one didn t answer me at all that second one may god have mercy on his soul he was martyred while the battle for yarmouk is very typical of syria s civil war the conflict here is unique most of those fighting on all sides are palestinians pro government factions besiege the area from the outside cutting off supplies and aid most of the time the inside is held by anti regime groups some of which are islamists the situation in yarmouk was thrust in to the headlines on april when isis fighters stormed the rebel held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings since then a local activist tells cnn isis has withdrawn to another area and left the al qaedalinked group jabhat al nusra in charge of the district the deepest circle of hell terrified yarmouk residents describe isis raid but this is only the most recent in a deadly urban war that is slowly grinding down yarmouk s buildings and people of the more than that used to live there only about remain according to unrwa the u n agency tasked with aiding palestinians i have been to yarmouk on various occasions and the picture has always been the same pro government factions surrounded the area and there was house to house combat mostly at night a lot of destruction very little territorial gain for either side all of it taking a horrifying toll on the civilians trapped in the middle we have no food or water one resident said standing amid the ruins of yarmouk s houses they should open a route so we can eat and drink and they can deliver assistance and food we have nothing what can we do but international aid groups can do very little there are few occasions where aid is allowed into yarmouk or where civilians are allowed out unrwa can only care for those who do manage to escape u n official to visit besieged refugee camp the agency along with the syrian arab red crescent runs several shelters for displaced people in government controlled areas near the camp pierre krahenbuhl the commissioner general for unrwa recently visited some of them and acknowledged that far too little help was reaching those who need it most we have to call on the world and call on all the actors in the world who can influence the situation to mobilize krahenbuhl said but much more has to be done to respect the civilians and to make sure that they are safe inside the camp but of course those still inside are by no means safe subjected to shelling bombing and street combat on top of being thirsty hungry and in need of medication but one thing that has not been broken is the residents self respect and pride this is yarmouk camp and we are not leaving our homes one man said whatever happens if they keep hitting us with barrel bombs we will die an elderly woman recalled her life as a palestinian refugee i fled palestine when i was seven years old she said but i will not leave the yarmouk camp even if i am or years old yarmouk camp is equal to my soul i built it with my bare hands i carried its stones on my head from a village and laid the foundation to my home block by block i carried them on my head but despite their defiance there s seemingly nothing that can be done to prevent yarmouk from being reduced to rubble this is a war of attrition two sides fighting for inches in tough combat without seeing that they are wrecking the prize they claim to be fighting for desperation for palestinians trapped in syrian refugee camp

ten years ago a prosecutor in centre county pennsylvania took a day off work and vanished since then the case of ray gricar has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes dug up a grave chased more than reported sightings from arizona to north carolina dropped fliers over slovenia consulted a psychic interviewed a member of the hell s angels and enlisted nasa technology but no one has been able to find the veteran district attorney who was when he disappeared when he went missing that friday morning on april he left behind a live in girlfriend a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast approaching retirement his red mini cooper was found abandoned near a bridge on the susquehanna river about miles away from his home months later his county issued laptop and hard drive were found separately on the banks of the river too damaged to read as far as hard evidence goes that s about all police have the best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive what s left is theory speculation and a case that s been cold almost from the beginning when a district attorney goes missing you know it s pretty big it s going to catch people s attention a lot of people don t have a large footprint this guy had influential friends he was well known said todd matthews director of communications and case management for the national missing and unidentified person system or namus from the start investigators have considered three possibilities gricar committed suicide fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away the prevailing theories have been suicide or walk away especially since when a search of his google history on his home computer found that someone had been searching how to fry a hard drive and water damage to a notebook computer gricar a private and quiet man was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing and cigarette ash was found near his car even though he was not a smoker friends and colleagues recalled him being distant in the weeks that led up to his disappearance and recounted his fascination with another law enforcement official from ohio who vanished in matthews said that namus has compared gricar s dna to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in but so far none has been a match even if he chose to make himself go missing it sounds like something was terribly wrong that caused a drastic change in his life there s something wrong if he s googled how to fry a hard drive did he google it did someone else google it was he threatened did he do something and is trying to cover it up it s not a normal thing to google that matt rickard the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case he said he s still holding out hope that someday technology will allow investigators to recover the damaged data i think there is something out there whether it s evidence or a person there s something that could lead us to something he said in all honesty somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason we have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive in when former penn state defensive coordinator jerry sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys it was revealed that it was gricar who decided not to charge sandusky when the first victim came forward in gricar cited a lack of evidence the intrigue already simmering in gricar s case exploded sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases but investigators said there was no evidence that gricar s disappearance had anything to do with sandusky s crimes but some have stuck to the homicide theory suggesting that gricar was an enemy of mob like gangs in central pennsylvania who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions cyril wecht a forensic pathologist said he considered writing a book about gricar his ties to the sandusky case and whether it led to suicide but wecht said he abandoned the book idea when it became clear there was not enough evidence i don t think it s a great stretch wecht said he was one of those guys with a very strong sense of justice and professional discipline and in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed i speak as a forensic pathologist who s done so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point it s pure conjecture not based on any factual knowledge plus wecht said if it was a suicide i don t understand how they never recovered the body bob buehner a former district attorney in montour county pennsylvania who was gricar s friend has never accepted a suicide or walk away theory he believes his colleague was killed buehner has doubts that years later state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case it didn t seem like there was any overall game plan that made sense in terms of a systematic investigation buehner said one of the things i d asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do to do a hotel motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with ray and then match the names with photo ids which police have access to buehner said those records are now gone and his faith in finding gricar is dwindling i give it a at best and only because i m an optimist and i hope that s what will happen he said as a pessimist maybe in that we ll find him despite fresh eyes on the investigation when it was handed over to state authorities last year the mystery woman has not been found pennsylvania state police continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case said centre county s district attorney stacy parks miller everybody regardless of what position they held deserves this kind of attention in any missing persons case he s not the only one we feel discouraged when we can t answer the questions for the family but it doesn t change our dedication to the case the case has gotten significant attention on the national level appearing on several true crime television shows including hln s nancy grace so it was strange to many in pennsylvania that for years a case with such a high profile would be handled by the tiny bellefonte police department where one investigator was assigned to juggle gricar s case along with several more in the state police took over but that was nine years after gricar went missing and two years after he had been declared legally dead sources close to the investigation told cnn the case as state police received it was disorganized and porous evidence had been compromised in storage reports were missing evidence had been collecting dust in file cabinets there was never a forensic audit of his finances today some of gricar s friends believe the case is damaged beyond repair they have lost faith that there will ever be any answers when asked if she thought things might change when state police got the case barbara gray his ex wife and the mother of his daughter lara said no the evidence is the same she said lara declined to comment and investigators said they ve had trouble reaching her there is always a remote possibility that we might never have an answer said lt james emigh who leads the investigation for the pennsylvania state police after inheriting it last year we still hold out hope and the state police will however continue to diligently follow up every possible lead and attempt to bring closure to the family and friends of ray
as americans mark the th anniversary of abraham lincoln s death this week let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages but also belongs in a special way to illinois lincoln s two greatest legacies indivisible union and irreversible emancipation grew organically from his midwestern roots he knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton the entire region from the appalachians to the rockies drained through the mississippi river enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through new orleans and from there to the world he thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular or dixie more generally the u s landmass he insisted is well adapted to be the home of one national family and it is not well adapted for two or more because there is no line straight or crooked suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide lincoln supplemented his midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly midwestern claim about constitutional history the union is older than any of the states and in fact it created them as states lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the constitution s text clearly prohibits unilateral secession the constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land no matter what an individual state says but lincoln s additional assertion that the union created the states not vice versa provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country most virginians including confederate gen robert e lee insisted that of course virginia had come first at the outbreak of the american revolution the old dominion was already a century and a half old generations of lees had helped govern virginia long before the united states was born but if lee was first and always a virginian lincoln was an american his father came from virginia his grandfather hailed from pennsylvania and before that the family had probably lived in new england abe himself had been born in kentucky and had moved as a boy to indiana and later as a young man to illinois these latter two midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the union itself these places had begun as federal territory the common inheritance of all americans and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life when young abe moved to indiana it was just becoming a state thanks to federal governmental action it was a wise set of federal policies proper land surveys and a commitment to public education that had drawn the lincolns and countless other kentuckians to leave the bluegrass state for a brighter future in the midwest retracing lincoln s assassination years later that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery the old northwest had always been free soil as provided for by a northwest ordinance that predated the u s constitution the words of the th amendment the only constitutional amendment that lincoln would live to sign promised to end slavery everywhere in america and did so by borrowing verbatim from article of the northwest ordinance true geography is not inexorable destiny many other midwesterners in lincoln s era embraced slavery and secession hugo black the supreme court justice who did the most to make lincoln s constitutional vision a reality over the next century was born and raised in alabama but geographic variation has always been a large part of america s constitutional saga in the election that brought him to power lincoln swept almost all the northern states but did miserably in the slaveholding south john wilkes booth the dastard who ended lincoln s life years ago this week was an embittered extremist from a slave state so was lincoln s nemesis on the supreme court chief justice roger taney taney s most infamous ruling the pro slavery dred scott decision in had emerged from a court dominated by the south although slave states accounted for less a third of america s free population this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court remembering lincoln s murder in our era given the fact that republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last years the court has been rather moderate much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern republicans on the court most notably minnesota s harry blackmun illinois john paul stevens and new hampshire s david souter all nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal new england at harvard or yale and the republican appointee most attentive to gay rights anthony kennedy grew up in northern california a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles which takes us back to lincoln when anthony kennedy was a lad in california s state capital the governor a friend of the kennedy family was a lincoln republican named earl warren a man who would later author the court s iconic opinion in brown v board of education vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by lincoln and his allies today both parties at their best claim lincoln jeb bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and rand paul is a kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach hillary clinton was born an illinois republican and the leader of her adopted political party who also happens to be president is a lanky and brainy lawyer from illinois who knows how to give a good speech and who swept to power in by recreating lincoln s geographic coalition winning every state within a four hour drive of chicago in the largest sense then all americans of both parties and all regions whether or not they have ever set foot in illinois are living in the land of lincoln

washington cnn isis is a problem that is off the charts historically and has sent the united states into uncharted territory when it comes to putting down the terror group the obama administration s point man in the fight recently told cnn the comments which brett mcgurk made in an exclusive interview were some of the administration s strongest to date in describing the challenge the united states and its allies face in battling isis this is a problem that is off the charts historically he said referring to the more than foreign fighters who have gone into syria just put that into perspective it s about twice the number that went into afghanistan in the s over a year period to fight the soviet union and those came really from only a handful of countries he concluded we re in unchartered territory here mcgurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in jordan last week canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against isis over syria the united states now lists countries in the coalition as the u s led coalition has focused attention on iraq and syria isis has expanded its reach to libya egypt and yemen often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants mcgurk did not rule out expanding u s military action beyond iraq and syria to combat the increasing regional threat we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests some of which are military tools he said of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do the united states has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis to date that involvement has been extremely limited as sunni tribes see shiite militias many with horrendous human rights records take the lead but mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister haider al abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar province in the coming weeks he stressed the importance of working with al abadi noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar province last week handing out more than ak s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces we are helping to enable and train them as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in anbar mcgurk said they put out this very perverse twisted vision and it s very attractive to a lot of young men around the world he acknowledged but in fact what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraq is that they re more likely to get killed in iraq and syria and in fact instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them they re more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani that bottom line he assessed could turn the tide the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it s like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate and i think we re going to see those networks begin to dry up

west of baghdad iraq cnn the call from faleh essawi the deputy chief of the provincial council who we were supposed to be meeting up with came just as we were about to hit the bridge the only safe route from baghdad to neighboring anbar province isis has taken the east of the city it s not accessible he says sounding frantic rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas isis fighters had just stormed into moments later we see the impact an endless stream of humanity shell shocked and exhausted parents cradle babies in blankets some struggle under the weight of their belongings some carry small plastic bags while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the euphrates the government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into iraq s capital those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men normally used to carry produce to markets an elderly woman sits in one a child in her arms a worn down plastic doll in her hand many don t want to talk at least not for long what they just went through is too raw too painful one man we encounter describes how isis fighters commandeered his house we heard clashes in the early morning and we couldn t see the security forces anywhere he recalls we saw the isis fighters they just came into the house they didn t say a word they just sent a sniper to the roof i grabbed my children and ran his wife bursts into tears prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore they just want to keep going another older woman sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren starts sobbing the moment we approach her they took our homes and kicked us out she cries over the weekend isis moved into towns just to the north of ramadi which lies miles km west of baghdad sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city isis had already blocked off access from the south months ago and the west was contested territory the east until now was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit at a hospital in amriyat al falluja about a minute drive away a wounded local fighter winces in pain he was shot by a sniper in ramadi that morning as isis fighters advanced the bullet barely missed his heart we had been warning we could see their movements he tells us but we just didn t have the force to hold them off we didn t leave a single person we didn t call and ask for back up but none came hours after our morning conversation we speak to essawi again by phone security is collapsing in the city he screams this is what we warned baghdad would happen where is baghdad where is al abadi just god knows if we will survive this he says and hangs up amriyat al falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from isis positions nearby the hospital s façade is scarred by shrapnel the wards are full of people injured during these attacks fifteen year old mustafa ahmed has bandages on his neck leg and other parts of his body a mortar fell on our street one of my neighbors was wounded he explains we went out to help him and the second one fell on us his friend died he says in the next room amal ahmed speaks softly i was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open she says as tears roll down her face something fell out of me and i grabbed it and i put it back in and i lay down she starts to cry harder her husband was killed by u s forces in fallujah another city in anbar in her children have all moved away except her youngest who broke his arm in the same attack when i see the situation i don t have hope it s just getting worse a few moments later we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital s buildings they think it s an isis rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the iraqi forces we are with in the hallway away from the windows more explosions go off in the distance then another actually shakes our building anyone want tea one of the policemen with us asks laughing as he pours this happens all the time we re used to it the police chief major aref al janabi radios to his men to respond al janabi like so many others is frustrated with the lack of support from baghdad earlier he had taken us to the front lines a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions he says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for isis positions but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements more explosions follow in the distance we re quickly moved out and leave the town heading back towards the bridge and the long snaking lines of refugees an ambulance passes us trying to force its way through the crowds the swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours not surprising given essawi s dire assessment and warning ramadi is under siege from all sides he d told us earlier anger mixed with an air of resignation i consider the city to have fallen he claimed that have fled scoffing at statements from iraqi officials in baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to ramadi he has yet to see them

the white house insists it doesn t need congressional approval for the iran nuclear deal announced this month but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without congress the obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history getting congress signature might be worth the effort true the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy but it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of congress the president and his advisers have avoided using the term treaty instead explaining that it would be a nonbinding agreement according to secretary of state john kerry we ve been very clear from the beginning we re not negotiating a legally binding plan we re negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement on meet the press kerry said what we re looking for is not to have congress interfere with our ability inappropriately by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the president there is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues with the potential for court challenges but outside of the legal debate there are also significant political questions and those are a different beast altogether for a start there is growing pressure on capitol hill from members of both parties to pass legislation that would give congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions on tuesday a deal was reached on legislation proposed by senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker that would require president barack obama to submit the final deal to congress giving it days to review and approve the agreement corker told msnbc on tuesday that negotiators had reached a bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact full of integrity what s in the iran bill and why all the fuss there is good reason for obama to avoid calling this a treaty after all given the contentious political environment on capitol hill where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best but there is also a history of congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties in the late s for example president jimmy carter tried to obtain consent for the salt ii treaties but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that carter was weak on defense carter pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail after iranians took american hostages and the soviets invaded afghanistan the treaties died in the senate yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political capital and even once the white house exited the struggle bruised and battered the historic treaties endured top gop dem senators say iran compromise reached this was the case with another treaty that carter asked the senate to ratify the panama canal treaties of carter decided that turning authority of the canal over to panama was essential to regional peace and stability he knew this would be tough sell and tennessee republican howard baker for his part predicted he wouldn t even get votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the committee to save the panama canal and the emergency coalition to save the panama canal indeed they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the soviets a foothold in the region however carter countered aggressively both on a personal level helping secure the vote of sen richard stone of florida by sending a personal letter to the senator dispatching experts to florida to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state of the art telephone hookups in the end the senate ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two thirds majority although carter also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight president ronald reagan faced a similar challenge toward the end of his presidency he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the soviet union yet despite excitement in the white house and across the nation about soviet leader mikhail gorbachev s visit to washington in december many conservatives blasted the decision arguing that reagan had betrayed the conservative cause during a meeting at the white house eight republican senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with reagan sen malcolm wallop of wyoming one of reagan s closest allies said the soviets have broken most every treaty they have ever signed how do we assure compliance with the new treaty right wing organizations meanwhile compared reagan with neville chamberlain reagan responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion in a hearing on the treaty secretary of state george shultz attacked north carolina republican jesse helms who had accused reagan of confusion misstatements and even misrepresentation he met with republicans spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal despite their protests most republicans eventually came around on may the senate ratified the treaty helms one of the few to vote against the treaty admitted they were licked and the treaty which marked the beginning of the end for the cold war has endured the reality is that the signature of congress is still worth a lot in american politics the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas all this will be true with iran especially as many members of obama s own party are leery about the agreement ultimately the president probably has the right to go his own way with this and his frustration with congress might create strong incentives for doing so but in the long term persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war and would help prevent iran from becoming a nuclear power the good news is that there have been some statements from the white house that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of congress in a solid deal now it s time to see if the administration follows through

it s no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week s gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro but this first meeting of obama and castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story or at least obama is hoping it won t be after all the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region and obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the u s is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends but who have drifted away as america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east unfortunately america has lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china a cunning russia and a troubling iran all of which have made inroads in the region at washington s expense this gathering therefore offers a chance for the u s to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with latin american and caribbean blood who make their homes in the united states the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there but they need attention and the panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building but first do no harm large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events and the u s with its vast experience in preparing for high level multilateral meetings knows the importance of dotting the i s and crossing the t s but this hasn t stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and pr disasters for the u s just look at the last summit held in cartagena colombia which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after secret service agents embarrassed the united states by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms in violation of basic security protocols they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee as a result of all this the americans looked dumb incompetent and cheap and back in the president new on the job was caught flat footed by a fast talking fiery anti american president of venezuela the late hugo chavez outplayed the leader of the free world who had just taken office and was trying to show america s new outstretched hand toward the foe of the george w bush era the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and as the cameras clicked handed the american president a copy of the book open veins of latin america which blames the region s woes on the u s and europe yet the problems in cartagena weren t just symbolic regional leaders lined up against washington which had refused to include cuba in the summit and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless havana was also invited america was cornered all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton years when the president issued an invitation to democratically elected heads of state of latin america which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship back then the u s had just led the creation of the north american free trade agreement nafta and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region namely democracy free trade and economic growth that s what it should aim for every time articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it can obama manage something similar this time true the president has come armed with his new cuba policy unfortunately in an effort to placate critics who say obama is not doing more for pro democracy activists the white house has miscalculated with venezuela handing the repressive regime of chavez s successor nicolas maduro a stick with which to beat the u s obama has long and rightly ignored maduro s claims that the u s planned to overthrow him but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed maduro who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country a way to portray himself a victim of the u s something he will no doubt play that up in panama all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with latin americans who already have complicated feelings toward the u s over its cold war support for unseemly right wing dictators a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing soviet backed communism from taking hold but those days are behind us today the people want prosperity they want democracy and they want the rule of law all of which leave a potential opening for the united states too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms opposition leaders are in prison in venezuela a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in argentina press freedom is under siege in several countries and corruption is reaching new highs all of this suggests that if obama plays his cards right he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goals are also america s goals that like them he supports democracy human rights the rule of law full freedom of expression and free elections in every country the fact that he met with cuban dissidents was welcome and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with cuba for the millions in latin america that still live in poverty these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury but if obama can show them that the united states is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives then he will leave a longer lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake
parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy australian prime minister tony abbott has announced currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons or by stating they are conscientious objectors and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits under the new no jab no pay policy the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting january the choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments said abbott in a joint statement with social services minister scott morrison thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments with the australian government estimating more than children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents objections the number of children in australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade according to the government anti vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in western countries some parents believe the shots cause autism but the theory has been widely discredited existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said abbott but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened it requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government this is a very significant narrowing morrison told reporters in sydney on sunday he added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations in response to the announcement more than people have signed a petition in opposition to the reforms

while the fight against isis in syria and iraq holds the world s gaze a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention the deterioration of al qaeda in an audio message released sunday al qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders known as ustad ahmad farooq and qari abdullah mansur were killed in cia drone strikes in january in north waziristan near the afghan pakistan border farooq s real name was raja mohammad suleman al qaeda said he was a pakistani who acted as the group s liaison to the pakistan taliban and was the deputy commander of al qaeda s south asia branch mansur s real name was qari ubaidullah a pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against u s and nato troops in afghanistan al qaeda s south asia branch is relatively new announced with some fanfare back in september by al qaeda s top leader ayman al zawahiri the creation of the terror group s south asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from isis which is embroiled in a public dispute with al qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement the deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al qaeda s bench of leaders on monday in the southern pakistani city of karachi local al qaeda commander nurul hassan was killed in a raid said arif hanif district inspector general of police florida raised adnan shukrijumah who was in charge of al qaeda s operations to attack the west was killed in december in a pakistani military operation texas born mohanad mahmoud al farekh who also played a planning role for al qaeda s operations was arrested in pakistan last year the deaths of ubaidullah and suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al qaeda left except al zawahiri both ubaidullah and suleman were pakistani this is an indicator of how al qaeda has become a largely pakistan focused group increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of pakistan or afghanistan indeed al qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the west the last successful al qaeda attack in the west was the london transportation system bombings a decade ago al qaeda is now reduced only to holding american hostages such as year old aid worker warren weinstein who was kidnapped from his home in the pakistani city of lahore on august to be sure al qaeda s yemen based affiliate al qaeda in the arabian peninsula or aqap continues to pose a threat to american aviation the group has built hard to detect bombs which it has placed on u s bound flights luckily those bombs were faulty or were detected the group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris in january killing but it s not clear if aqap had any direct role in planning this attack meanwhile isis continues to attract western recruits and also inspire homegrown terrorists in the west but the core al qaeda organization that killed almost men women and children on is on life support al qaeda s confirmation of the deaths of ubaidullah and suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment
tulsa oklahoma cnn amid growing scrutiny over whether a year old volunteer deputy who killed a suspect during a sting operation was qualified to be policing the streets a new report raises a troubling allegation some supervisors at the tulsa county sheriff s office were told to forge reserve deputy robert bates training records and three who refused were reassigned to less desirable duties the tulsa world newspaper reported claims that the volunteer deputy s records had been falsified emerged almost immediately from multiple sources after bates killed eric harris on april reporter dylan goforth said bates claims he meant to use his taser but accidentally fired his handgun at harris instead the newspaper s story does not say who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why but the orders apparently started years ago before harris death back when bates was trying to get on as a deputy reporter ziva branstetter told cnn s new day the sheriff s office denied the allegations in the tulsa world s report it also declined a cnn interview to respond to the claims in an email to cnn the department s maj shannon clark said the lack of named sources in the newspaper s report leaves him dubious just keep in mind that the tulsa world reporter cannot validate her sources and claims anonymity which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive clark wrote clark brewster an attorney who represents bates said the accusations are based on an affidavit from a former sheriff s office employee who s now facing a first degree murder charge i don t put a lot of stock in that report or the credibility of who would further that report brewster said shooting casts spotlight on volunteer police programs sheriff stanley glanz and other sheriff s officials have repeatedly insisted bates was properly trained the tulsa county sheriff s office has released a summary of bates training courses only over the past seven years the office rejected cnn s request for the full training records because bates case is under investigation branstetter said she s run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who d signed off on bates training records you would think the sheriff s office if in fact there has been no pressure applied no falsification of records that they would be forthcoming with these documents she told cnn s new day we ve asked for them they ve said they don t believe they re public records bates was classified as an advanced reserve deputy for the sheriff s office that means he would have had to complete hours of the field training officer program to maintain that classification the paper said bates would also have needed firearms certification training but the sheriff himself has acknowledged there is a problem with bates gun certification records his office can t find them bob went out and qualified with three different weapons with an instructor glanz told kfaq radio this week he said bates qualified with a young lady that was a firearms instructor but she is no longer there she has left the sheriff s office and is now a secret service agent glanz told kfaq and we re trying to get a hold of her and talk to her about we can t find the records that she supposedly turned in so we re going to talk to her and find out if for sure he did qualify with those opinion who gave this reserve cop a gun even before the tulsa world story inconsistencies were apparent in bates history with the sheriff s office in his statement to investigators bates said he became an advanced tcso reserve deputy in but the tulsa county sheriff s office has said bates had been a reserve deputy since it also said bates had undergone hours of training that would be less than the hours of field training that the tulsa world said is required to be an advanced reserve deputy which bates claimed to be in a statement he made to investigators after the shooting bates said the gun he used was his personal weapon adding that he last qualified at the range in autumn he also said he d attended numerous schools and seminars related to drug investigations and the tactical operations associated with the apprehension of suspects involved in drug trafficking a five day homicide investigation school in dallas and training from arizona s maricopa county sheriff s office on responding to active shooters but an arizona official told cnn bates never trained with the agency he didn t come to arizona the official from the maricopa county sheriff s office said and he certainly didn t train with us brewster said that line in bates statement was referring to a lecture given at a seminar in washington by maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio the seminar was part of extensive training bates received at classes across the country and through work in the field he said he met every training regimen brewster said he met every requirement and all he did was give of himself bates is now charged with second degree manslaughter for harris death he turned himself in to authorities tuesday and immediately posted bail of his attorney has said he s not guilty calling the death an excusable homicide the lawyer for harris family claims bates wasn t qualified to be on the force but received preferential treatment because he d made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff an accusation officials deny saying they stand by his training record tulsa police sgt jim clark who has been brought in to review the case has said bates fell victim to something called slip and capture

for lt colonel john schwemmer the scenery is all too familiar this is his sixth tour in iraq and he s back doing a job that he s been tasked with before training iraqi soldiers schwemmer and other active u s military personnel are on the ground in iraq whipping often ill equipped government troops into shape they ve been here before but this time he feels they re getting it right but the u s military isn t the only contingent of western forces in the region dozens of foreigners including americans have volunteered to take the fight to isis and increasingly u s military training efforts are being supplemented by outside agencies who are working with kurdish government troops and even militia in iraq and syria many of us do feel that we do have the skills and qualifications that can be used to benefit those in the region said ian bradbury a canadian former soldier who is training kurdish peshmerga forces in northern iraq while it is difficult to say how many foreign volunteers are fighting isis a spokesman for a kurdish militia fighting against them in syria known as the ypg told the new york times their forces include more than american citizens u s law enforcement officials say it is illegal to join a syrian militia but some organizations have set up recruitment drives online featuring applications for foreign fighters complete with checklists of what to bring and advice on bringing body armor across international borders jordan matson a year old former u s army soldier from the tiny town of sturtevant wisconsin volunteered with the ypg he told cnn that after much soul searching he realized that he needed to help in the battle against isis brutal expansionist regime i got in contact with the ypg on facebook and prayed about it for probably a month or two and asked is this what i want to do and eventually you know decided to do it all my life i wanted to be a solider so i guess this just fits well over here but foreign fighters aren t universally welcomed by those opposing isis the peshmerga the military wing of the kurdish regional government krg that has been one of the most effective counterbalances to isis expansion has said they don t want or need foreign fighters according to bradbury the information i ve been getting back is that there s very little use for western fighters on the front lines especially on the krg side they have significant numbers of personnel it s a source of kurdish pride for them to rise up in scenarios like this they more need the development assistance peshmerga spokesman helgurd hekmat also told kurdish news wire rudaw that it was illegal for foreigners to join their ranks while individual fighters are not always accepted volunteers working as military trainers are sharing their expertise to support those on the front lines of the fight against isis forces bradbury set up st north american expeditionary forces st naef a training body which he says is currently providing material support and training to the peshmerga whose name means those who face death in northern iraq internal capacity building is by far the solution that you can put into a region that is suffering instability from conflict he told cnn by phone from his base in ottawa canada increasing their ability to maintain stability over the long term is far better than trying to influx it with a bunch of westerners who are going to leave within a short period of time he was prompted to establish the group after seeing fairly significant gaps in the support provided by the coalition forces for the kurdish iraqi regular and militia ranged against isis the u s military is confident that its support of the forces battling isis on the ground is sufficient we re confident the u s military mission of degrading and ultimately defeating isis will be found by working through our middle eastern partners and the international community maj omar villarreal communication integration planner u s central command communication integration directorate told cnn the training element of the mission is no different it relies on direct and comprehensive military cooperation with regional partner nations who share a mutual interest in promoting security one of the goals of the train and equip program is to build the capabilities of the moderate syrian fighters to defend the syrian people we are confident in our efforts with coalition members keen to distance themselves from calls for western boots on the ground and little political appetite from overseas for risking western troops in what many see as a sectarian conflict bradbury contends that the best case scenario is exactly the kind of logistical support that organizations like st naef are providing isis is keen to play up religious and sectarian divisions in order to create the perception that they are the sunni protectors of a persecuted underclass sending non arab troops into the battlefield even in a support role could play into that divisive rhetoric bradbury downplays this risk saying the threat is there and is best contained in the region providing noncombat backing such as medical weaponry logistical and training assistance would appear he thinks to be the best way of supporting those kurdish and arab troops on the front regardless of perceptions of any kind of us against them scenario it absolutely is a world against isis issue that needs to take place and there definitely needs to be a global response he said

from late january when new england was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters to a warm and sunny afternoon in april the jurors in the first degree murder trial of former nfl star aaron hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother in law odin lloyd the jury of seven women and five men listened to more than witnesses and reviewed more than pieces of evidence over the months long trial on wednesday they convicted hernandez who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after deliberating more than hours over parts of seven days after the verdict jurors agreed to meet with reporters at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process here are five things to know about what they said while declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision it s a very big decision to make and every one of us made sure we came to the best conclusion one juror told reporters at one point on monday jurors asked judge susan garsh to allow smoking breaks which were permitted during trial some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations a male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony it was hard for everyone said a woman on the jury everyone s life changed because of this asked to elaborate she told a reporter i ve been here for as long as you have it s the hardest thing i ve ever done in my life she said later about serving on the jury absolutely by far asked whether they would say anything to hernandez one of the women on the panel said simply nothing others nodded in apparent agreement do they have any feelings about the year old former star for me judge garsh said keep your mind suspended said a female juror we went in there every day with open minds we listened to the evidence we heard what they had to say we got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that s when we came to our conclusion did they know anything about hernandez or the case before the trial one juror responded nothing very little said another about six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a new england patriots fan the jurors said they found out about hernandez s other legal woes from garsh only after they reached a verdict hernandez potentially faces three more trials one criminal and two civil actions next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a boston nightclub in july prosecutors have said hernandez fatally shot daniel de abreu and safiro furtado when he fired into their bmw another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment the families of de abreu and furtado filed civil suits against hernandez and a judge froze his million in assets pending the outcome of the double murder trial the freeze includes the disputed million signing bonus payment hernandez claims he is owed by the new england patriots hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in miami in february alexander bradley claims hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a miami strip club it s amazing a lot of the information we learned today a female juror said wednesday i think we can all say we made the right decision some jurors admitted to not knowing who patriots owner robert kraft was when he took the stand at the trial but they agreed that kraft s testimony was crucial kraft testified that hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that he hoped that the time of the murder came out because i believe he said he was in a club to this day we just went through a three month trial and this is now two years later we still don t know the exact time of odin s murder a male juror said so i don t know how aaron would have had that information two years ago another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of lloyd s family and friends for me it was in the beginning the pictures a woman said of autopsy photos of lloyd s bullet riddled body you re told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears that was hard one man said his time on the case made him appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be and that the justice system can work the system is designed to be fair to both sides he said in fairness you can t rush the jurors did not find credible the defense team s contention that hernandez s co defendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz carried out the murder the two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately in closing arguments defense lawyer james sultan for the first time placed hernandez at the murder scene sultan described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp as men capable of killing someone in drug induced fits of rage did he make all the right decisions no sultan said of hernandez he was a year old kid who witnessed something committed by somebody he knew he really didn t know what to do so he put one foot in front of another keep in mind he s not charged with accessory after the fact he s charged with murder and that he did not do we were all shocked about that a female juror told reporters wednesday it was very surprising said another asked about post trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case a female juror smiled none of us wanted to come into this room she told the reporters gathered around her the jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully wednesday night after a beverage one of them added asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends they all seemed to say yes
panama city beach florida cnn a third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of panama city beach the bay county florida sheriff s office said wednesday police arrested the suspect at p m tuesday after developing information that george davon kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape bcso investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest according to a news release investigators discovered that kennedy had family in dekalb county georgia and reached out to the sheriff s office there deputies in dekalb in the atlanta area tracked down kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators the bay county sheriff s office said kennedy is from murfreesboro tennessee and has been a student at middle tennessee state university the sheriff s office said previously ryan calhoun and delonte martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators the sheriff s office said calhoun was released saturday after posting bond martistee remains in bay county jail a county deputy said troy university in alabama said the two are students and have been placed on temporary suspension from school per the university s standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures martistee a member of the track and field team has also been removed from the team martistee is represented by a public defender calhoun s legal representation is unclear no public statement has been made on either s behalf the arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched the woman didn t recall the assault police say but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news and though the footage had to be blurred she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities it s not the first time this has happened to a young woman in panama city beach authorities say four young men were involved in the assault bay county sheriff frank mckeithen said and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness it s unclear if the person arrested tuesday was someone the police had been looking for there s hundreds hundreds of people standing there watching looking seeing hearing what s going on mckeithen said and yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere i will tell you it is not acceptable in bay county authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects said ruth corley spokeswoman for the sheriff s office authorities are pressing charges and the woman plans to cooperate corley said investigators were to meet with her this week after interviewing witnesses bay county investigators determined the alleged rape took place between march and march behind spinnaker beach club a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers she does not remember the assault at all corley said she remembers taking a drink from a camelbak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged camelbak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks she was visiting panama city beach at the time of the assault and is now home authorities said the troy alabama police department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the bay county sheriff s office the video shows suspects pushing the victim s hand aside and holding her legs down corley said you can see in the video there are people two feet away they were assaulting her and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted the suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her corley said authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened corley said the sheriff s office released part of the video to local tv stations which blurred portions of it before airing cnn is showing part of what was released while the video is one of the most disgusting repulsive sickening things that i ve seen this year on panama city beach it s not an isolated incident mckeithen said this is not the first video we ve recovered it s not the second video it s not the third video there s a number of videos we ve recovered with things similar to this and i can only imagine how many things we haven t recovered corley said that through social media we have been able to find video of girls incoherent and passed out and almost like they are drugged being assaulted on the beaches of panama city in front of a bunch of people standing around about spring break revelers come to the beach community every year this year the bay county sheriff s office made more than arrests for various crimes about triple the

thousands of syrian and palestinian refugees trapped in the yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities but while the story is in itself tragic it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus jihad and mohammad tiny vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days a place that was described last week by the u n secretary general ban ki moon as the deepest circle of hell the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children looking into those bright young faces touching their pristine hands the logic of our humanitarian mandate the mission to protect never felt stronger to me like the wider syrian conflict yarmouk has a human face the faces of young mohammad and young jihad i want to introduce you to them in the hope that you too will understand why i am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in syria jihad ya qoub the youngest palestinian refugee to flee yarmouk was born on march his mother said fatima never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough i was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items she said said fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just calories a day mohammad was born in yarmouk on january of this year when isis islamic state of iraq and syria entered the camp and tensions heightened his mother nadia fled in search of safety her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future she hopes that if and when life returns to normal she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in yarmouk these tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all when i next brief the security council as i did a few days ago i will tell them about jihad and mohammad i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside yarmouk other civilians who need help where they are to do this hostilities will have to subside pressure must be exerted on armed actors in yarmouk to this end beyond that those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely these things are all possible but it takes the necessary political will nothing more nothing less yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold i believe they can because to abandon such belief would be to abandon jihad mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them and that is simply not an option

robert bates says he gets it how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun bates the tulsa county oklahoma reserve sheriff s deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect told nbc s today show friday that he used to think that too believe me he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the april death of eric harris it can happen to anyone harris died after bates shot him accidentally he says after calling out taser taser in a tussle captured on a police body camera bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser while bates is at the center of the maelstrom over harris death he isn t the only one under scrutiny the oklahoma naacp wants charges against other officers involved in harris death and a state and federal investigation into the tulsa county sheriff s office s treatment of minorities the sheriff s office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge bates training records in his interview friday with today bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies that is absolutely the truth i have it in writing he told the show and on thursday a sheriff s office official denied to the tulsa world newspaper that any records had ever been forged as an advanced reserve deputy sheriff s office policy calls for bates to have completed hours of the field training officer program according to the tulsa world bates would also have needed firearms certification training officials have yet to locate records showing what training bates completed said maj shannon clark of the sheriff s office but clark did say it s possible that some training requirements may have been waived sheriff stanley glanz has the authority to waive any department policies clark said the policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization that s part of being a sheriff s office clark told the newspaper glanz told kfaq radio this week that officials can t find records of bates firearms certification the instructor who provided that training is now a u s secret service agent and officials haven t been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in glanz told the station other discrepancies have surfaced about training that bates claims to have attended including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction tulsa world reporter dylan goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that bates records had been falsified the newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why but the orders apparently started years ago back when bates was trying to get on as a deputy reporter ziva branstetter told cnn s new day bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to glanz s re election campaign leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop he rejected that claim in the today interview as unbelievably unfair bates attorney clark brewster also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded he said those making the accusations include fired sheriff s office employees represented by the law firm that also represents harris family his training is extensive and certainly adequate brewster told cnn on thursday bates appeared on the today show with his wife two daughters and brewster he seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened i can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days bates said i m not at all sure it s not still with me today lack of sleep inability to concentrate all of those plus more you know i still can t believe it happened in describing the events leading up to harris death bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch harris in the act of illegally selling a gun bates said he had participated in several hundred such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and clean up after deputies taking photos and notes but as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward bates position as deputies were trying to subdue harris bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control i yelled taser taser as required in training the deputy below me ducked he pulled away from it so that i could bates said the laser light is the same on each weapon i saw the light and i squeezed the trigger bates told today the result was not the staccato click of a well deployed stun gun instead it was a gunshot i shot him i m sorry bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident bates apologized to harris family who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs harris brother andre harris said this week that he didn t think the shooting was racially motivated instead he said this is simply evil but bates who is charged with second degree manslaughter said he didn t mean to kill harris his attorney has called it an excusable homicide i rate this as no on my list of things in my life that i regret said bates who is free on bail
garissa kenya cnn the desks of the small madrassa are empty its students all male are staying home after kenyan president uhuru kenyatta announced three days of national mourning following last week s deadly attack at a nearby university only a few kilometers away people mostly students were brutally massacred when al shabaab militants invaded the campus in garissa a town in northeastern kenya we ve come to this particular islamic religious school because the man suspected by kenyan authorities of being the mastermind behind the atrocity mohamed mohamud once taught here he was someone who was very quiet he didn t like too much talk recalls sheikh khalif abdi hussein the principal at the madrassa he says he also taught with mohamud for two years when he left the madrassa he joined al shabaab but before he was normal just like me and other people what worries authorities here is exactly that mohamud was kenyan but now say officials mohamud is in command of an al shabaab militia based near kenya s long porous border with somalia about miles km from garissa who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross border attacks into kenya the islamist militant group who are allied with al qaeda have been waging a bloody campaign for control of somalia with kenyan troops part of an african union force deployed in support of somalia s united nations supported government kenya has now become a target last year an attack by al shabaab on a shopping center in the country s capital nairobi claimed the lives of people now mohamud stands accused of being behind thursday s attack the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than people at the u s embassy in nairobi in but mohamud is not kenya s only homegrown terrorist the kenyan interior ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also kenyan abdirahim abdullahi was in his s and the son of a government chief his father says he lost contact with his son in shortly after he left university the kenyan government is concerned that al shabaab is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities president kenyatta said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre meanwhile sheikh khalif insists his madrassa has nothing to do with mohamud s extreme violent ideas this man is a dangerous man a killer a criminal he says but he was also once a neighbor and so kenyans must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country s and the region s stability
it s not easy being the pope not only does he shepherd nearly billion catholic souls he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country as scholars like to say the vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries sometimes as when st john paul ii stood up to communist poland the church s moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch at other times popes have to make a hard choice adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat this sunday in rome pope francis faced just such a dilemma first the back story one hundred years ago more than million armenians some estimates run as high as million died at the hand of the turks many of the victims were part of a branch of christianity closely aligned with catholicism a slew of historians and at least countries call the killings a genocide a u s resolution to do the same has languished in congress turkish officials disagree arguing that the deaths while unfortunate were part of a long running war that witnessed casualties on all sides for their part previous popes had finessed the genocide question john paul ii used the g word in but didn t dare speak it out loud instead it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the armenian church after they had celebrated mass together pope emeritus benedict xvi called the killings a great evil and terrible persecution in a speech but avoided labeling them genocide benedict found other ways to tick off the turks initially opposing their entry into the european union as pope francis prepared to celebrate a special mass sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word genocide he did but in a roundabout way by quoting john paul s document in the past century our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies francis said the first which is widely considered the first genocide of the th century struck your own armenian people the middle phrase comes directly from the document issued years ago by john paul in citing his predecessor francis highlighted one of the vatican s chiefest concerns especially on matters of moral import continuity whether holding the line against artificial birth control declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins the vatican and the papacy love continuity said the rev thomas reese a vatican analyst for national catholic reporter if francis had not called the armenian killings a genocide particularly at such a high profile event the audience included armenia s president it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy reese said at the same time francis didn t want to anger the turks more than necessary especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of christians by isis in the middle east which the pope alluded to in his speech on sunday the fact that he quoted john paul is a sign that he s downplaying it reese said of the armenian murders he s telling people there s nothing new here new or not turkey was not happy the nation recalled its vatican ambassador for consultations just hours after francis comments the turkish foreign ministry said turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart the vatican s ambassador for a meeting turkish state broadcaster trt reported in a tweet sunday turkey s foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu called the pope s use of the word unacceptable and out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations the tweet reads hatred and animosity are not words often used to describe pope francis because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world emphasizing mercy over judgment it s easy to miss the bluntness francis brings to the bully pulpit on matters of doctrine and diplomacy he may be carrying on catholic traditions but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes this pope is decidedly different he has helped broker a backroom detente between the united states and cuba and invited israeli and palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the vatican after annoying some israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the west bank from jerusalem but francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop isis slaughter of christians warned of the mexicanization of argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch on monday the pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning mass he must have heard the hubbub about his genocide remark but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly without fear and to bear the courage of their convictions just as the early apostles had we cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard francis said cnn s gul tuysuz and jethro mullen contributed to this report

the lawyer for robert bates an oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a taser on saturday released documents that he says verify some of bates training as a law enforcement officer the documents show bates had one taser training class over a six and a half year period took three firearms training classes and qualified times from to to use a handgun his evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public robert bates has met all the requisite training required by oklahoma to be a reserve deputy said the lawyer scott wood in an interview with cnn read the documents cnn could not independently confirm the documents were authentic wood said he got them from bates who asked the tulsa county sheriff s office to provide his training records the sheriff s office has turned down cnn s requests for the training documents saying they are part of the investigation authorities did not reply saturday to a request for comment on wood s statements the documents are important because bates training has become a central issue in the case the lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that bates wasn t qualified to be on the force but received preferential treatment because he d made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff the tulsa world newspaper reported some supervisors in the tulsa county sheriff s office were told to forge bates records and were reassigned when they refused the tulsa county sheriff s office has denied these allegations the documents provided to cnn cover the period from july to december bates had one taser training class on march according to a document with a heading from the council on law enforcement education and training which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state wood said the council requires only one hands on class on use of a taser bates had weapons training once in september and twice in according to sheriff s office records that bates obtained wood said he scored high enough at the pistol range times from september to april that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty wood said bates is charged with second degree manslaughter in the death of eric harris friends and family of harris gathered in tulsa on saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing bates is free on bond he says he meant to use his taser on harris during the april arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead i shot him i m sorry bates is heard saying on video of the incident bates an insurance company executive has gone to his own defense in an interview friday with the today show on nbc bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies that is absolutely the truth i have it in writing he told the show questions have already been raised about bates training and when his service with the tulsa county sheriff s office started in his statement to investigators bates said he became an advanced tcso reserve deputy in wood said bates started working for the sheriff s office in late or but the sheriff s office has said bates had been a reserve deputy since bates who worked as a police officer for one year in the s completed hours of training and hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy according to the sheriff s office the tulsa world said hours of field training are required to be an advanced reserve deputy which bates claimed to be questions have been raised about bates firearms qualifications scores to be allowed to carry a pistol on duty deputies need to score while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range wood said documents with a heading firearms qualification record show bates scoring at least on six different days but firearms qualification records from four dates in and are missing for the entire sheriff s office wood said the tulsa county sheriff s office says it can t find the records the department s summary of bates weapons training shows he scored those four times if you re going to forge somebody s score why not give them a or a wood said cnn provided the documents to the tulsa world ziva branstetter an editor with the newspaper said the new information doesn t undercut the world s reporting these records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story she said saturday another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes bates took on two days the council on law enforcement education and training records show bates took training classes worth credit hours on december and classes worth credit hours on december wood said bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes it s possible you could take a half hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in minutes he said evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of bates one from march says of his strengths works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well his weakness radio usage geography remedial training does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on will have to work on his geography skills both will be remedied in time

standardization stress from the job is an accepted part of our career however sometimes during the course of an airline pilot s career or anyone s career for that matter stress issues may manifest as depression depression is treatable and for airline pilots it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood the federal aviation administration now approves certain prescribed medication allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor as the world learns more about andreas lubitz the co pilot on germanwings flight it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression he reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness but lubitz s illness didn t just appear out of thin air its effects had to be apparent to others lubitz s girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge unfortunately after events took their course considering the hoops lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings co pilot it s curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed to what hoops am i referring first let s start with his passion for gliders glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor the sport involves teamwork interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety i m a glider pilot participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent second lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansa s flight program a requirement of germanwings employment the selection process is most likely highly competitive requiring above average aptitude is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed regardless the process had to be a stressful experience opinion germanwings and the stigma of mental illness once accepted into the flight program a rigorous training period began for primary training lufthansa utilizes an ab initio from the beginning program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear arizona near phoenix the training is geared toward a multi crew pilot license or mpl recognized by the international civil aviation organization the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers countries that don t have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner requiring as much as hours to qualify as a co pilot this is a fairly recent change in faa regulations initiated as a result of the colgan airlines crash in buffalo new york lubitz had barely over hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror as a year old flight instructor i had that much flight time it hardly qualified as a lot of experience as with all of the mpl programs the training involves an intense period of airline specific instruction and to add insult to injury candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride regardless the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about using both actual flight experience in a single engine airplane and simulator time the student receives about hours of training it is a period of almost constant supervision aside from observing and checking performance criteria wouldn t at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment and wouldn t a fellow trainee have noticed also according to reports lubitz took a leave from his training a very untypical behavior was that not in and of itself a red flag wouldn t a manager in lufthansa s flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues after all the selection process was most likely highly competitive with other qualified candidates readily available once the primary training in arizona was complete lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a he was about to fly again no one observed issues but even more curious according to reports lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa over the course of a career an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues even if we have never flown with a particular individual experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn t quite right that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines or perhaps through a simple conversation in that regard i find it difficult to believe that none of lubitz s colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time as supplemental background germanwings had been established as the low cost alter ego carrier of lufthansa depending upon a pilot s monthly flight time salary for pilots can be as much as lower than the mainline carrier in addition more days on duty were part of a germanwings crew member s schedule apparently as late as march lufthansa pilots had been on strike one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered lubitz s absence regardless all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick year old man the world knows the end result it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen could it have been prevented well this is the primary purpose of accident investigation never allow the same tragedy to occur again

i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother my younger sister and brother the compartment was extremely crowded as we prepared to disembark i felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts it was terrible i wanted to scream but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd i wanted to push the hands away but my arms were pinned to my body i wanted to cry but could only think to myself stop it please stop touching me i was years old i never told anyone about that day until recently twenty five years later i continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces the stories can be stomach churning men masturbating on buses and at bus stops boys stalking young girls both physically and online men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the internet then there are just the everyday uncomfortable stares frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations this isn t all simply anecdotal a study by we the people found that of women in mumbai had been street harassed primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms most people including women only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching groping and stalking not to mention the milder forms of ogling leering catcalling and whistling even though all of this can be intimidating indeed many women choose to limit their hours outside select more conservative clothes or opt for a longer but safer route home it was only recently that i realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience i had as a child i still avoid trains when i can most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women it was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop i led that staring and commenting by men is normal and i ve learned to ignore it the reality is that sexual harassment in india is pervasive in all aspects of life it hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street take local transport go about your daily routine or at the workplace according to u n women s report in women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime this statistic is likely even higher in india out of the women who have attended workshops i ve conducted only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives shockingly less than of them had reported harassment to any official channel why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment over the past two years i have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in india it is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment i know firsthand but acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step india has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser but is it enough women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling ashamed and bringing disrepute to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged however despite the barriers two recent cases in india provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference there is for example the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss rajendra pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked his counsel stated in court that pachauri s inbox was not hacked but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name similarly last year tarun tejpal founder of one of india s leading media companies was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator she first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously she then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police tarun tejpal who explained the incident as a bad lapse of judgment was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing women have allies both male and female who are willing to help clear the barriers women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up the alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives restricted and disempowered we cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine we cannot ignore it for our own sake and the next generation of women

can you imagine paying a month in rent to live in a one car garage nicole a year old woman doesn t have to imagine this scenario because it s her everyday reality the small and unusual living space is all that this employed single mother can afford in her high cost community in san mateo california nicole isn t alone in her struggles cnn recently published a powerful piece called poor kids of silicon valley that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the bay area one aspect featured a house that is home to people including children another chronicles a husband and wife named rich and stacey both of whom have jobs who are living in a san jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don t have the money to go anywhere else although silicon valley has unique characteristics it isn t the only community confronting these challenges our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis the agency i lead the u s department of housing and urban development recently released a report estimating that million low income households live in substandard housing spend more than half their incomes on rent or both these are families who are dedicating out of every they earn just to keep a roof over their head and the more they spend on housing the less they have to invest in their children s education build up savings and shop at local businesses these are outcomes that hurt our nation s economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action hud is working with local partners across the country to do just that first we re focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists since the mid s we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than affordable units but by we re in danger of losing more than because these mortgages are maturing ending agreements to control rents in these units so we ve launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come we re also doing the same with public housing right now the nation is losing units of public housing every year mainly because of disrepair hud created the rental assistance demonstration initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good it s cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as lexington north carolina where the local housing authority is making years worth of repairs in just months including new lighting modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs rad has allowed local communities to raise more than million in new capital to date that s why we re asking congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program no american should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home in addition to preservation hud is also working to create new affordable housing a harvard study revealed that in there were million extremely low income households and only million affordable units available it s clear that we can t preserve our way out of this problem we ve got to grow the supply to meet demand so hud is taking a multifaceted approach for example our home investment partnerships program is leveraging in private and other public resources for every in home funds and leading to more than million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families this is more than just a statistic it is progress for people from the families living in the broadway crossing development in washington to the seniors living in the woodcrest retirement residence in pennsylvania to keep this momentum going we ve asked congress to increase home funding by to keep building affordable homes prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation we are also asking congress to expand our housing choice voucher program which allows recipients of modest means the elderly and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market this includes restoring vouchers that were lost to sequestration and we re targeting our resources where they can have a big impact for instance hud awarded million in targeted homelessness assistance to programs across the san francisco bay area including silicon valley in january and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment to empower communities president barack obama has also requested million for new local housing policy grants to help them increase housing affordability economic growth and access to jobs all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast to coast our nation s affordable housing challenges won t be solved overnight and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper let s not squander this chance to make real progress for american families incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all

a jury of rolling stone s media peers has dissected the magazine s disastrous discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone s lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice made all the worse by the magazine s head in the sand reaction to the thorough devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism rolling stone s egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable the magazine s decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not before the original story a rape on campus was pulled from the rolling stone website it registered million hits following its publication in november more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine s history an anonymous undergraduate given the name jackie told rolling stone writer sabrina rubin erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by phi kappa psi fraternity in only to end up beaten and gang raped by seven boys who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student a casual acquaintance who had invited jackie to the party the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity a police investigation the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t rees shapiro took a closer look leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism that review which is considerably longer than the original article reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice rolling stone writer erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations she never spoke to three of jackie s friends who allegedly talked with jackie immediately after the attack and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when and at every step of the way when jackie began acting flaky refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter neither erdely nor her editors or the magazine s fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade including one semester at columbia i would agree with colleagues who call rolling stone s lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom i ve told students for years you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond and you should never take a source s word about important facts without verifying the truth there s a reason we call it reporting and not dictation most of all i tell students remember that you re writing about human beings who are complicated creatures the good guys are never all that good and the bad guys usually aren t completely bad people can be mistaken or deceitful i tell young reporters they frequently forget and often lie to themselves that doesn t make a source useless but it must make you extra careful unfortunately the early word from rolling stone is that they ve absorbed none of these lessons publisher jann wenner has apparently decided not to fire demote or discipline anybody at rolling stone provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists no one fired at rolling stone really wrote cnn media critic brian stelter what would rolling stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably damaged people s lives but punished no one tweeted john bresnahan the capitol bureau chief of politico rolling stone outsources its investigation to columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward ok tweeted pundit joe concha worse still the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim rolling stone s senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story s failure does not require them to change their editorial systems the columbia report says and check out this amazing conclusion from will dana the managing editor who presided over the disaster dana told the columbia team it s not like i think we need to overhaul our process and i don t think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things we just have to do what we ve always done and just make sure we don t make this mistake again that smug attitude pretty much ensures rolling stone s newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future at a minimum they should heed the wise counsel of my friend bill grueskin an executive editor at bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the columbia j school when doing big investigative stories reporters face many challenges recalcitrant sources complex numbers buried records editors whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity are spared most of those hurdles but they face their own internal newsroom challenges particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story grueskin writes they must keep their star reporters happy trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic the problem could be says grueskin that rolling stone had too many chefs in the kitchen instead of a single talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae until wenner and his team learn that basic lesson and revamp their hiring editing and fact checking process accordingly the rolling stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming

the public outrage over the religious freedom bills recently passed in arkansas and indiana caught the governors of those states completely off guard judging by their confused and contradictory responses as poll watchers they surely knew that most americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality they had better adjust to a new reality for the past three decades socially conservative evangelicals and pro business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations environmental initiatives and social welfare programs while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in america s population for many this alliance been puzzling other equally devout christians who place more emphasis on jesus christ s message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor have been uncomfortable with it as have many business leaders their priorities after all are based on the bottom line and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination or even passive acceptance of it threatens that bottom line hence after indiana gov mike pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same sex couples the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift from groups as diverse as the national collegiate athletic association the indiana pacers walmart eli lilly apple and even the marriott international hotel chain marriott international was founded by j w marriott a dedicated mormon and is now run by his son bill also a mormon who fully accepts his church s teachings about traditional marriage yet in june marriott international launched a love travels marketing campaign aimed at attracting lesbian gay bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of the company s commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same sex honeymooners marriott pointed to the bible s injunction of unconditional love but added beyond that i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business in global spending by lgbt travelers was estimated at more than billion and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel so marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti gay bias a cnn poll taken in february found that of millennials nationwide believe that same sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid even among white evangelical protestants of millennials support same sex marriage compared with less than of those their grandparents age and older it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts but that is no longer possible according to researchers for mtv s look different anti bias campaign of youths aged to agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place and almost say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias so who s the moral majority now for media savvy millennials following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it in the first hours after arkansas passed its version of the religious freedom bill the twitter hashtag boycottarkansas was used times it then snowballed after celebrity blogger perez hilton tweeted it to his million twitter followers america has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity whether that pertains to race ethnicity gender or sexual orientation since the majority of children that have been born in the united states each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and women now lead men in educational attainment and more than half of americans live in states where same sex marriage is legal business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril
editor s note ines dumig was recently announced as a center grant recipient sahra a somali refugee left her home at years old throughout her journey in search of asylum she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts but she never gave up and she continuously reminded herself to keep going she s the focus of ines dumig s photo series apart together dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio a shelter in munich germany for refugees and torture victims what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences it really impressed me how she deals with everything dumig said she s strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened the culture where she comes from the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by last year with germany receiving the most applications one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle another reason has to do with dumig s interest in people s emotions and finding one s identity i realized so many people want to come to europe and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away dumig said seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am apart together serves not only as a documentation of sahra but as a far reaching story about people from all backgrounds the title of dumig s work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together sometimes we feel strong sometimes we feel lost that s kind of universal i think dumig said that s why i want to universalize sahra s story as well not only make it about her the underlying themes of apart together include the feelings of isolation and otherness and the search for a valuable human dignity social media follow cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography every one of these refugees have strong stories and in the bureaucratic system they are just a number or a document dumig said but they are a person they are people with emotions and lives sahra is currently under the status of suspension of deportation meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience determined to establish a new life for herself she has learned to speak german fluently and she has started working in the nation as well like an unsolved photographic puzzle each photo within apart together provides a piece of insight into sahra s experiences there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra s life many of dumig s photos are not of sahra herself but instead show her surroundings this makes apart together rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one i think everyone interprets by themselves by however way they perceive it through their own experience that s up to the viewer dumig said it depends on who looks at the pictures everyone will see something different apart together allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra and they were both able to learn from each other it was just something we both got something out of dumig said ines dumig is a photographer based in germany

in response to reports of big banks threatening to withhold campaign funds from senate democrats sen elizabeth warren last week offered a defiant response bring it on warren said she isn t going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in wall street as hillary clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality former maryland gov martin o malley who is also running for the democratic nomination is trying to steal clinton s thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth in other words there are many signs that democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality but in other recent news the likelihood that new york s chuck schumer will replace harry reid as leader of the senate democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality while schumer has been a very effective democrat and skilled legislative leader he is also a wall street democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state he is not alone even at his most progressive moments president barack obama relied on wall street donations for both of his campaigns despite all the talk from conservatives about left wing socialism in the white house the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to democrats without much concern even in the election democratic populism can t really work within the current campaign finance system the enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on democrats despite their political base to court big donors during the s california democrat tony coelho serving as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee and then as majority whip made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money the democrats were and have continued to losing their traditional base of campaign support organized labor which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the s providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing many democrats concluded they needed business by their side democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices in obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the post watergate public finance system for campaigns altogether preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign while small donors were enormously important to his victories so too were business and wall street executives at the height of the financial crash when public sentiment had clearly turned against wall street the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill dodd frank that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years wall street with an army of counsel succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices democrats can make but it also greatly damages the party s brand name as the washington post reported the scandal that might bring down new jersey democratic sen robert menendez is the first involving large scale super pac donations at the heart of the story is almost that physician salomon melgen gave to senate majority pac possibly in exchange for favors this is not simply some sort of accommodation of democrats to the corporate system they don t have much of a choice without these funds they won t be able to compete in this election cycle independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir in conservative circles the koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda individual donors such as las vegas gambling magnate sheldon adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak pressuring them to adjust their agenda democrats have found their own magnates for political support such as tom steyer and george soros this is why campaign finance reform is so important without congress changing the fundamental dynamics there won t be much room for populism to thrive even if democrats select someone like a elizabeth warren as their candidate or hillary clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy there won t be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts the democratic party needs wall street more than it needs to take a stand against wall street those are the facts on the ground if democrats really want to take on wall street and tackle economic inequality they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system if campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures wall street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence reform could level the playing field more often than not campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support a more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system if things stay the same democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support

moscow cnn joy womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the kremlin ballet theatre kicking her legs up to her head jumping and spinning across the room after class she eats boiled sweets one after another they are a cheap form of energy the dancer raised in california and texas left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in russia six years ago aged speaking no russian she studied at the bolshoi ballet academy and was one of the first americans accepted from the school into the company but in she left under a cloud media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed boshoi official to pay to dance in even small roles the bolshoi still stands by comments made at the time by its general director vladimir urin he asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that if the facts are legally established those responsible should be punished accordingly the dancer did not pursue a case against the bolshoi when she left the bolshoi in womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works aged as a principal ballerina dancing close to the russian president s office next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not for her role as a principal dancer womack says she is paid around a month which works out at around a day the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russian ruble has weakened the currency has suffered in part from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food for anyone paid a salary in rubles especially since the crisis it is extremely difficult you have to decide what is worth more for you experience or financial stability i m at a point in my life where experience is worth more sitting in the wings of the stage chatting in russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for swan lake she says she has to make the in her bank account last for the next few weeks to earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad the kremlin ballet theatre says womack s salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that on average the salary principal dancers are paid is significantly higher than a month but that womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month as an american womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the russians but she says that is not always the case offstage it s extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the united states and russia the great thing about working for a russian company is that we are focused on creating art but outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover although relations between the u s and russia have taken a nosedive since russia s annexation of crimea last march womack says she is very loyal to the kremlin ballet theatre i love the russian system and i m very patriotic in that sense she says and despite the political situation and the money she says russia has a lot to offer it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one s career in

duhok iraqi kurdistan cnn the children laugh and shriek as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents a small group plays with rocks replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago made up of some tents and counting thousands of yazidis now call this corner of iraqi kurdistan home about miles kilometers from one of the front lines with isis where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes the vast majority of the camp s occupants are from the town of sinjar which is near the border with syrian kurdistan and fled the isis assault there back in august but not everyone escaped isis took thousands of yazidis captive the fighters separated the young women and girls some as young as years old to be sold as slaves for their masters to use as concubines men faced a choice convert to islam or be shot mahmoud was out running errands when isis fighters arrived taking his wife ahlam their three children the youngest of which was just a month old and his elderly parents they took our phones jewelry money ahlam recalls they had guns they forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks they were taken to a school turned prison in tal afar from there the family was moved from village to village and at one stage taken to mosul they wrote everyone s name down and they asked where we want to work in the fields as cleaners or as herders she says ahlam and her family chose to herd goats they were then taken to a shia village whose residents had fled where they were part of a group of around living in one house in the home ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband i said we are alive but we are prisoners ahlam s husband who up until that moment had lost the will to live thinking his family was dead says he cried out of happiness despite his pain ahlam would call when she could briefly after midnight hiding under her bedcovers if she was caught with a phone she would be killed the village itself was a massive prison its entrances guarded by isis fighters she recalls that two men in their late s or s tried to escape when they were caught their bones were broken their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets the yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle the men s corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them one night some of the yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies to give those slain what dignity they could ahlam tells us that about a week before we met isis fighters came by and took away her in laws and the other elderly people living in the house we didn t know where they were taking them we thought we would be next she remembers so she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee we decided that either we survive or we don t they left at midnight ahlam cradled the baby as her two other children ages and years old clutched at her clothes she prayed the baby wouldn t cry that the children could keep walking they knew the general direction to take but not the exact route and they could only hope it was toward freedom when the sun started to come up i thought that s it we are going to get caught ahlam says and what am i going to do with the kids i can t carry all three of them and run luckily ahlam never had to answer that impossible question the group made it into iraqi kurdistan the couple can t put into words their emotions when they were reunited mahmoud gently caressing his daughter s palm says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with and their three children were by his side again it had been eight agonizing months but their joy was tainted by fear for mahmoud s parents a few days after mahmoud and ahlam were reunited isis released captives no one is disclosing exactly why among them were children a handful of men and women and the rest were elderly including mahmoud s parents we didn t know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us mahmoud s father says they moved us around a lot and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days but ahlam s parents are still with isis vian dakhil a yazidi member of iraq s parliament speculates that the yazidis isis released are individuals they were struggling to care for dakhil is part of iraqi prime minister haider al abadi s delegation to the united states this week she will be addressing the united nations pleading for more international support for iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat isis and she will address the plight of the yazidis we sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred this would be better than being kidnapped and raped we prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women dakhil says it is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this how to get these captives back it s inconceivable that in the st century something like this is happening as if we were living in the stone age ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children which we re told makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as

tokyo cnn a japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country citing safety concerns a court official told cnn japan s nuclear watchdog the nuclear regulation authority had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors and of the kansai electric power company s takahama nuclear plant but locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui prefecture where the plant is located raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake japan s nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the fukushima disaster in when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant since then the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs japanese prime minister shinzo abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy arguing it is essential to the country s economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports but opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart keith henry managing director of tokyo based asia strategy which advises businesses on japanese public policy issues says the decision will force abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy that was a body blow for abe because it s no longer a political issue it s a legal issue it changes the calculus and the dynamics he said it s now in the courts and the government is powerless to do anything about it read more power company abandons robot stranded inside fukushima plant anti nuclear activists celebrated following the fukui district court s decision in their favor tuesday the nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the fukushima disaster it said in a statement that scientific and professional findings showed that the safety of the reactors was assured but the court ruled that the new safety standards were loose lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant an official said the power company said it would appeal the decision we deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended and cannot accept it at all it said in a statement chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told reporters tuesday that the country s nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the world s strictest safety standards the government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart he said takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture s governor although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court analyst henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the takahama decision as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives prior to the fukushima disaster about of japan s energy was nuclear generated cnn s junko ogura contributed to this report from tokyo
the jailing of four blackwater security guards eight years after they killed iraqi civilians in a shooting in baghdad is a positive step for justice but is also not enough the kind of horror represented by the blackwater case and others like it from abu ghraib to the massacre at haditha to cia waterboarding may be largely absent from public memory in the west these days but it is being used by the islamic state in iraq and syria isis to support its sectarian narrative in its propaganda isis has been using abu ghraib and other cases of western abuse to legitimize its current actions in iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant sunni resistance to american aggression and to shiite betrayal as phrased in an isis publication from late titled the revived caliphate which chronicles the rise of isis since as the iraqi government today struggles to regain the support of sunnis in its fight against isis or even renew intra sunni trust this invocation of american transgressions by isis should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in iraq the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the american intervention in iraq not only paved the way for abuses like abu ghraib and blackwater it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country and today isis is reaping the benefits the u s poured money into iraq after the invasion but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the iraqi government this enabled the shiite dominated government of former prime minister nuri al maliki to discriminate against the sunni community the united states was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like blackwater without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior it also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating iraqis all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by isis to push its own version of iraqi history in the revived caliphate abu ghraib is invoked three times as the place where iraqi sunnis who resisted the u s ended up as a result of their betrayal by shiites who collaborated with the americans the publication first recounts attacks on abu ghraib at the height of the american intervention by al qaeda in iraq aqi isis predecessor to free imprisoned sunnis who had been detained by the americans it then presents the sahwa awakening of when sunni tribes collaborated with the u s to fight aqi as a case of intra sunni resentment that led the tribes to hand over aqi members to the americans where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of abu ghraib according to the publication it then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by isis in to free those who had been tortured by the americans and shi a as the publication puts it over ten years in bridging a decade of history and in placing the shiites squarely in the category of enemy isis is sending a strong message that its current fight in iraq is about reversing longstanding injustices against sunnis and restoring a sense of sunni belonging under the umbrella of the caliphate the civilians killed by the blackwater guards like the abu ghraib prisoners were both sunni and shiite but the repackaging of history by isis in which the saddam hussein regime is reinvented as a sunni regime that tried to stand up to the united states and its shiite allies glosses over those nuances the reproduced images of abu ghraib prisoners in the aforementioned isis publication juxtaposed with images of civilian deaths as a result of u s airstrikes against isis targets are presented as proof of the group s narrative and they are reinforced with text that frames america today as the air force of the shi a it is becoming clear that isis cannot be defeated in iraq without buy in from the country s sunnis without sunni help isis will continue to frame the conflict as one where sunnis are once again being attacked by the u s and the shiites particularly as shiite militias have become a key part of the fight against the terror group in places like tikrit to balance out this shiite involvement the u s and iraqi governments are counting on the establishment of a cross sectarian iraqi national guard and hoping to resurrect the awakening to re engage and unify the sunnis under a nationalist umbrella but those plans will not succeed unless serious steps are taken to ensure that good governance measures are in place to hold both iraqis and all those affiliated with the anti isis coalition to account this should not just apply in the context of the current conflict so that scenarios like abu ghraib and blackwater are not repeated but also when the dust settles good governance is the most effective antidote to sectarianism
on the surface the mix up seems incomprehensible how can a volunteer sheriff s deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser killing a man that s apparently what happened in tulsa oklahoma when a year old reserve deputy robert bates killed eric harris bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead oh i shot him i m sorry bates said in a video of the shooting but it s happened before in a well publicized case a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser killing year old oscar grant in oakland california the former officer johannes mehserle testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct so how easy or hard is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser here are some factors to consider law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer s dominant side of the body and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side so if an officer is left handed the gun should be on the left side bates attorney said his client is left handed but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side his nondominanant side i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed bates said in a written statement to investigators after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser he used his nondominant hand and it was the gun said clark brewster bates attorney he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder assumed it was the taser brewster said both the gun and the taser have a laser sight and he just made a mistake brewster also said his client s left hand was holding a pepper gun in his statement to investigators bates said he had grabbed a pepper ball launcher to try to slow or stop harris who was running away bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was startled by the recoil of the gun after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief he told investigators bates is now charged with second degree manslaughter if convicted he faces up to four years in prison deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in bates was carrying his personal gun a smith wesson five shot revolver and a model x taser he said in his statement to investigators attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices one held up a small black revolver followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun there s no way an officer can get this confused with this said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen smolen roytman taser s x model comes in different designs some are mostly yellow while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle but all appear to be larger than smith wesson five shot revolvers sgt jim clark of the tulsa police department which is separate from the county sheriff s office for which bates volunteered said bates was the victim of something called slip and capture that s when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high stress situation but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to junk science there s no peer reviewed articles that would support this it s not generally accepted by the scientific community said phil stinson an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university so it s something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence an attorney for the harris family said the slip and capture theory hasn t held up in court the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland of oscar grant the attorney said and that defense failed tasers are built to feel and look different than guns according to taser international steve tuttle vice president for strategic communications at taser noted some of those differences to cnn a gun is heavier a taser has a different grip and feel when you take the safety off on a taser an led control panel lights up there s more tasers can be different colors yellow or black and the holster is different from a gun s but in the field where an officer reacts on instinct there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important tuttle said taser s training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer s nondominant side as law enforcement experts say and its training suggests that officers shout aloud taser taser taser as they prepare to deploy it these guidelines are designed so that in the moment when an officer s muscle memory kicks in the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for it is up to each law enforcement department however in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular the stun guns or conducted electrical weapons manufactured by taser have been used more than million times tuttle said and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death cnn s catherine e shoichet brooke baldwin ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report

recently robert kennedy jr was in sacramento california to campaign against senate bill which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations in his remarks at an anti vaccination movie screening he decided to compare vaccine induced autism to the holocaust he said they get the shot that night they have a fever of a hundred and three they go to sleep and three months later their brain is gone kennedy said this is a holocaust what this is doing to our country a few days later he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the holocaust to many it s sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the nazis in a statement kennedy said i want to apologize to all whom i offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic i employed the term during an impromptu speech as i struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over million children and shattered their families robert kennedy jr has apologized for the wrong things first and foremost vaccines do not cause autism the two have nothing to do with each other second he seems to think people with autism are gone their lives destroyed and their families shattered autism is not a death sentence people with autism are not missing or destroyed they are everywhere trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman missing or worthless kennedy s rhetoric is a problem even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines people who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach based enemas others believing autism functions as a death sentence even kill their children i am worried about the effect of having such a powerful high profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism i reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment ari ne eman president of the autistic self advocacy network wrote robert kennedy jr who has engaged with autism only to spread lies misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic americans while his father uncle and many others in the kennedy shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo science to question our humanity these are harsh words but try to see the situation through ne eman s eyes not only is kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory but he s also suggesting that it s better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic the usual response to people like ne eman is that he is high functioning but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals henry frost an autistic teenager and writer is devastated by this focus on burden last year he wrote a post to other autistic children know you are not a burden or trouble for being you are a person who has every right to be a family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted the family is wrong not you meanwhile amy sequenzia an autistic activist and blogger wrote i am very disabled have most of the usual not autism but co occurring conditions seizures almost every day but am happy proud and accomplished with the human supports i have that s what is missing acceptance as children sequenzia and frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as gone by kennedy clearly both are very much present the solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity michael s monje jr an autistic writer and editor with autonomous press wrote the neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude it is a way for autistic people as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that natural the fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural less worthy or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world i wish kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities even as he defended the sacred status of the holocaust there is though one story from the holocaust that he might do well to consider the first group the nazis systematically exterminated in the infamous action t were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities thousands of children adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers laying the groundwork for the later larger scale acts of genocide underlying action t was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value we fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity not by fearmongering kennedy owes a lot of people another apology
debates on climate change can break down fairly fast there are those who believe that mankind s activities are changing the planet s climate and those who don t but a new way to talk about climate change is emerging which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one your health it s easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations but who wouldn t stop to think and perhaps do something about their own health or the health of their children this new way of talking about climate change and linking it to public health issues was part of a roundtable discussion tuesday at howard university s college of medicine president barack obama joined u s surgeon general dr vivek murthy and epa administrator gina mccarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of national public health week i think we ve always known or at least in the th century we ve understood that environment has an impact on public health the president told cnn s dr sanjay gupta i remember when i first went to college in los angeles in the air was so bad that you couldn t go running outside obama said you d have air quality alerts and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside we took action and the air s a lot better there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home so we ve got to do better in protecting vulnerable americans obama continued ultimately though all of our families are going to be vulnerable you can t cordon yourself off from air or climate murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger it s also personal to me because i ve cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath murthy said asthma can be very difficult for patients but also for their families the impacts of climate change could make the situation worse this is not just a future threat this is a present threat said brian deese a senior adviser to the president deese cited a recent study by the american thoracic society that found seven out of doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients the good news is that in addition to having doctors and nurses public health officials schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness and to in some cases impact their practice they anticipate for example increased asthma instances and plan ahead of time to deal with those obama told gupta what we have is companies like google and microsoft that are going to take data we re releasing and start developing apps so that potentially individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real time basis communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change said obama the impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors according to the environmental protection agency these factors include the effectiveness of a community s public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior age gender and economic status of individuals affected the epa says on its website impacts will likely vary by region the sensitivity of populations the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts and society s ability to adapt to change the world health organization estimates climate change will cause an additional deaths per year between and most will likely perish from malaria diarrhea heat exposure and under nutrition around the world variations in climate are affecting in profoundly diverse ways the air we breathe the food we eat and the water we drink writes dr maria neira director of the who s public health and environment department we are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health consider air pollution the single greatest environmental health risk we face in alone exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than million people one in eight deaths worldwide under nutrition already accounts for million deaths each year in the world s poorest regions rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields further compromising food security floods are increasing in frequency and intensity creating breeding grounds for disease carrying insects mosquito borne diseases like malaria are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity what will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable writes neira areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope developing countries will be hardest hit the health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider earth s average temperature has risen by degrees fahrenheit over the past century and is projected to rise an additional degrees over the next hundred years according to the epa small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather the agency warns many places have seen changes in rainfall resulting in more floods droughts or intense rain as well as more frequent and severe heat waves still there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather americans are no more likely today than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring according to a march gallup poll a time magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people s lives the article says this strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided if action is taken early enough the president said what happened with los angeles air proved that point when the clean air act was passed not only was there a terrible smog in los angeles it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country obama said the fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it s been much cheaper than anybody expected because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it as a consequence the american people are a lot healthier in addition to being able to you know see the mountains in the background because it s not covered in smog we know how to do this obama said we just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the american people have always displayed

the american pharmacists association is discouraging its members from participating in executions on monday the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy stating that such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers this bolsters the association s previous positions to oppose the use of the term drug for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection said michelle spinnler spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association that spotlight includes a january supreme court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in oklahoma this was prompted by clayton lockett s execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for minutes before he died from a heart attack in georgia last month the execution of female death row inmate kelly renee gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy thirty two sates allow capital punishment and lethal injection is still the most common method last month utah gov gary r herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available of the eight inmates currently on death row in utah three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection in texas the department of criminal justice told cnn in march they are running out of their supply in july lundbeck inc the manufacturer of pentobarbital decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose so states then turned to compounded preparations spinnler said pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way she says the new declaration by the american pharmacists association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the american medical association the american nurses association and the american board of anesthesiology
tokyo cnn a second robotic probe sent into the crippled fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow tokyo electric power company tepco deployed the second remote controlled robot last week after the first one broke down the robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively according to a statement released by tepco it is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation said akira ono the chief of fukushima daiichi plant tepco said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating though the cause was unknown it said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles the shape shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in march tepco says the site s still too dangerous for workers to enter the first robot which was sent in on april stalled after moving about meters according to a statement released by tepco a report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded tepco decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on april as it had already collected data on radiation levels in of the targeted locations completing around two thirds of the originally planned route the second robot was sent in on april and collected data from all points as scheduled four years after the devastating nuclear crisis the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter decommissioning work is estimated to cost billion and will take years to complete tepco called the robotic probe an unprecedented experiment cnn s yoko wakatsuki and junko ogura reported from tokyo japan and naomi ng wrote from hong kong

there are two paths to practicing medicine in america there s the traditional time tested way where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians then there s the approach being forged in florida and arizona getting elected to a state legislature lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice in florida enacted the firearm owners privacy act which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry i treat brain injuries and it s part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them like driving and handling weapons some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets typically fired by family members or themselves does anyone really believe i shouldn t talk about gun safety in these cases it s a good thing i don t practice in florida florida s gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it and while a three judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer doctors can still ask about guns while the full th circuit court of appeals decides whether it will take up the case a decision that could come down any day the president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics dr tommy schechtman told me he is a plaintiff in the case in arizona another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer bill goes a step beyond silencing doctors it requires them to lie the bill was originally a hum drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services a common state and federal strategy but legislators slid in a last minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill ru tell patients the pill is reversible that s the opinion of a particular san diego doctor who says this can be done through risky large doses of progesterone but the doctor hasn t proven his case and his regimen is not recommended by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists or the food and drug administration any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the san diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient doctor relationship i cannot imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the american bar association would never permit dr ilana addis chairwoman of the arizona chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the arizona house while planned parenthood and the aclu joined her organization in criticizing the provision the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor there s a common relationship shared by these laws beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer physicians don t all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote republican or democrat this is part of the reason the key state physicians associations aren t taking the lead in battling these laws the battle is left to the specialties most affected in florida that s the state s chapter of the american academy of pediatrics since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home in arizona it s the state chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists carrying the torch for physician free speech the florida medical association didn t provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law and the arizona medical association told me in a statement that arma s policy is to take no position on abortion representing physicians as a whole the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses the massachusetts medical society mss tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate doctor s day to the issue of physician free speech highlighting the threat posed by florida s gun law in particular members are concerned about the precedent being set arkansas enacted a law similar to arizona just days later the american medical association can do more it did file a friend of the court brief as part of the florida legal challenge but at this writing hasn t weighed in on arizona the ama didn t sign on to a statement released last week by the coalition to protect the patient provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care its huge lobbying operations are tied up in washington while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice now that the ama has won the age old doc fix battle ending automatic medicare payment cuts to doctors perhaps it will consider assigning some of its million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who ve abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession we have a surgeon general now vivek murthy and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april jonathan beeton a health and human services spokesman told me i hope murthy will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors
catania italy cnn the boat that sank in the mediterranean over the weekend with hundreds of migrants on board may have capsized after being touched or swamped by a cargo ship that came to its aid a u n official said carlotta asami a spokeswoman for the united nations refugee agency made the comments to cnn early tuesday after she and two of her colleagues had spoken to multiple survivors from the disaster who arrived in catania italy they say that there was a point in which they were very close and probably what happened is that you know a big ship creating a big wave they were approaching in a very strong manner and they lost balance asami said the account she offered differs from that provided by italian authorities on sunday they said that as the cargo ship king jacob approached late saturday migrants on the smaller boat moved to one side hoping to be saved and caused the vessel to capsize mark clark a communications executive representing osm maritime group the company that manages the king jacob denied that the cargo ship caused the migrant boat to capsize he said he also believed that people on the migrant boat rushed to one side causing many to fall off the cargo ship was going very slowly as it approached hardly making any waves clark told cnn it deployed rescue boats a gangway nets and life rings he said the conflicting accounts of the chaotic events highlight the challenges faced by commercial vessels that are often called upon to help in the escalating migrant boat crisis in the mediterranean asami said the survivors whom she and her colleagues spoke to were consistent in what they were saying she said their accounts made it credible to think that between and people were on board the boat that capsized roughly kilometers miles north of libya previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between and italian authorities who have been coordinating the rescue effort say only survivors were rescued and bodies have been recovered the king jacob whose crew members are all from the philippines saved of the survivors according to clark the cause of the shipwreck is part of italian authorities investigation said giovanni salvi catania s public prosecutor investigators want to study the king jacob s voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat he told a news conference monday the likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the mediterranean from north africa many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat while many people were down in the lowest area italian authorities said sunday that an unidentified bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in sicily on monday according to italian police officer maria guia federico they were the boat s tunisian captain and a syrian crew member said salvi the catania prosecutor italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to catania salvi said according to italian media the sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the mediterranean to which european governments are struggling to respond vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the mediterranean to southern europe for years but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue the number of deaths has also skyrocketed the international organization for migration said monday that more than people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between libya and italy just in the past week it reported monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters shipping companies recently warned that european governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble we believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large scale rescues with single ships having to rescue as many people at a time the european community shipowners associations said in a letter to eu leaders last month commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large scale rescues which also create serious risks to the safety health and welfare of ships crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations the letter said commercial ships rescued more than people in the mediterranean last year according to the international organization for migration that s higher than the more than people saved by the italian coast guard but lower than the rescued by the italian navy which was running a special program mare nostrum for most of the year european union ministers met monday in luxembourg and proposed a point plan to help address the crisis we are not yet working on numbers but what we have agreed on today is for sure the need to increase significantly the resources at sea and the level of the operation doing more search and rescue and doing it more together said federica mogherini the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security police mogherini told cnn that the european union must fight human traffickers strengthen europeans duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees we need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions mogherini said my pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died but some groups said european officials were offering too little too late what we needed from eu foreign ministers today was life saving action but they dithered said justin forsyth the chief executive of save the children with each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and europe slips further into an immoral abyss forsyth said in a statement right now people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics cnn s karl penhaul reported from catania and jethro mullen reported and wrote from hong kong cnn s hada messia isa soares and atika shubert contributed to this report

on october the italian government announced the end of mare nostrum a naval mission that rescued would be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the mediterranean to seek security and a new life in europe in the operation s year long existence the italian navy and coastguard had rescued an estimated people but it proved expensive and politically contentious and europe was not prepared to help italy shoulder the burden of the crisis without european support the italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants mare nostrum which had been launched after some people died when two migrant ships sank in was replaced by the more modest operation triton under the auspices of the european union s border agency frontex triton has about one third of the funding of mare nostrum with just six ships and patrol boats two planes and one helicopter it was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission at its inception klaus rosler operations director for frontex said triton is not a replacement for mare nostrum nor was frontex a coordinating body for search and rescue operations six months later the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for europe continues unabated contributors to triton include portugal the netherlands finland and iceland britain for example is not it argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are an unintended pull factor encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths it s perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot button issue in britain with the uk independence party attacking the conservative led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country similarly the opposition northern league in italy opposed mare nostrum accusing it of enticing migrants if the first few months of this year are any guide demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has people from syria mali and eritrea are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression violence and abject poverty despite the danger the great majority head first for libya where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered italy the european state whose territory is closest to libya has borne the brunt of the task of picking up sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants in migrants arrived in italy by sea italian ships have picked up about migrants in the past week alone the islands of sicily and of lampedusa which is closer to tunisia than to mainland italy see an almost daily influx of human misery and at this time of year there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve italian prime minister matteo renzi has said the mediterranean is a sea not a cemetery on sunday in the wake of the latest disaster he complained that italy had been coping with the crisis in near solitude sometimes assisted by some other international presence italy has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in libya not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants many of whom set out from around misrata and other ports in the west of the country according to some human rights groups the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril after the latest sinking the european commission called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers saying that the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold these are human lives at stake and the european union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini who is italian said sunday we need to save human lives all together as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings the task could not be left only to the southern countries she insisted but bold action is rarely a hallmark of the eu the recently installed head of the european commission jean claude junker has set out his priorities but they are yet to be acted upon junker said the current budget of frontex some million euros million was a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting europe s common borders that money has to cover all frontex s roles and it s not only the italian coast that is being targeted by migrants further east thousands of migrants are trying to reach greece by land and sea according to the un s refugee agency refugees and migrants crossed the mediterranean last year junker has also argued for greater assistance to the european asylum support office which is based in malta arguing for more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded most controversially junker is proposing europe adopt a common asylum system saying that one and the same applicant for asylum can have a chance of being granted asylum in one country of the european union and less than with the same reasons in another country but progress toward a europe wide approach on migration is painfully slow the european commission plans to publish a policy document next month but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject in the meantime the argument in european meetings is likely to focus on priorities with some the uk and germany likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people smuggling racket we must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys said british foreign secretary philip hammond sunday others including italy greece spain and france are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx but the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from libyan beaches will be oblivious to the debate read more migrant deaths

five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation s history we are still experiencing yet only beginning to truly understand its profound environmental and economic repercussions the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented with declines in tourism and the seafood industry as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region since then the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery in fact reports indicate that the gulf of mexico s seafood industry which supplies the united states with roughly of its seafood is finally starting to rebound however profound challenges remain in part because so many questions about the long term consequences remain unanswered to this day it s still unclear where all of the oil went exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab crabs play an important role in the region roughly million pounds were fished in the gulf in earning tens of millions in revenue yet in the aftermath of the spill changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye researchers documented substantial differences in appearance and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints forcing limbs to fall off these traits have affected not only the crabs market value but also likely their ability to survive while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short term the health of these crabs could still be precarious i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill using the power of genomics and computational biology we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab by studying gene expression the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and based on the types of changes we might see clues as to how the crabs respond although we are still in the early stages of our research we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce it s not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill this not only has consequences for the gulf area where oil drilling continues but also for communities along the atlantic coast where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration bp s vice president of communications geoff morrell told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have bounced back and there is no data that suggests there are any long term population level impacts to any species with the virtual certainty of more spills we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently the u s department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress in coming months they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill but government agencies cannot just rely on the short term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis instead the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing long term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what normal looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources

boston cnn now the real boston marathon trial can begin a federal jury s decision to convict dzhokhar tsarnaev of charges related to the boston marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes the year old s lawyers admitted from the beginning that their client had participated in the horrific terrorist attack which both scarred and strengthened this city the outcome of this first phase may have been preordained but nearly two years after the bombing the trial has held boston and the region in thrall more so than i might have imagined the case regularly lands on the front pages of our two daily newspapers the globe and the herald and often leads the local television newscasts the twitter feeds of reporters covering the trial are avidly followed we haven t learned much new although harrowing details about the deaths of the tsarnaev brothers four victims have come out more than anything many people find something cathartic in seeing the seemingly insolent unrepentant tsarnaev being brought to justice the only issue to be decided is whether tsarnaev should be executed which is why the second phase of his trial is the one that really matters was tsarnaev so thoroughly under the sway of his radicalized older brother tamerlan that he should be spared lethal injection or had this seemingly typical teenager transformed himself into a hardened jihadist who obsessed over al qaeda propaganda such as the article make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom what kind of justice should tsarnaev receive there is no death penalty in massachusetts and in september according to a globe poll of respondents supported life in prison for tsarnaev just said he should be executed by moving the case into federal court u s attorney general eric holder made it likely that tsarnaev would receive the death penalty keep in mind that no members of the jury were deemed eligible to serve unless they stated beforehand that they were willing to consider putting tsarnaev to death but imagine a different scenario in which tsarnaev had been allowed to plead guilty in return for a life sentence he would have been denied the public stage he has been granted although he has not testified so far his terrorist actions have been replayed over and over again for people to see the world over the boston marathon will take place in less than two weeks on monday april thousands of runners will clog the mile route and tens of thousands will cheer them on as they did last year proving to the world that we will not be intimidated and tsarnaev s lawyers will still be fighting for their client s life it is a natural if disturbing reaction to events like this that it s easier to remember the names of the perpetrators than of their victims but dzhokhar tsarnaev is a loser and a nobody he should be allowed to fade away into the obscurity of a maximum security prison cell the people who deserve to be remembered are those he and his brother killed on marathon day martin richard krystle campbell and lingzi lu and sean collier the mit police officer they executed in cold blood it is they who should live on in our collective memories

pope francis has accepted the resignation of bishop robert finn who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest ranking u s catholic official convicted in connection with the church s long running sex abuse scandal the vatican announced tuesday finn who led the diocese of kansas city st joseph missouri was found guilty in of failure to report suspected child abuse the case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims anonymity finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he d also faced he was put on two years probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine according to the jackson county prosecuting attorney s office two charges against his diocese were dropped at the time of his conviction finn said according to cnn affiliate kctv i truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused jackson county prosecutor jean peters baker said the conviction and penalty which included starting a fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse would have positive ramifications we can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the diocese of kansas city st joseph there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities baker said the case against finn revolved around his diocese s dealings with shawn ratigan an independence missouri priest who pleaded guilty in august to five child pornography charges church officials found disturbing images on ratigan s computer but didn t notify police until nearly five months later prosecutors said in those interceding months the priest kept on working and finn kept his job as bishop even after his conviction the official website of the catholic diocese of kansas city st joseph still listed him as its bishop tuesday morning cardinal sean o malley who took over the abuse shaken boston archdiocese and has become one of the pope s point men in the united states has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn t be allowed to teach sunday school was still running an american diocese it s a question that the holy see needs to address urgently o malley said in a minutes interview in november there s a recognition of that from pope francis candida moss a professor at notre dame a catholic university in indiana said it doesn t look very urgent that a decision came down only now nearly three years after the conviction and five months after o malley s comments several factors may have played a role in the delay including views from lawyers or power players at the vatican who may be reluctant to cast blame at high level officials who don t report allegations quickly enough to government authorities but the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in chile juan barros despite protesters claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there it kind of shook francis reputation said moss having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this especially in the u s i think this is a typical francis way to reinstall confidence now that the case has been addressed the kansas city st joseph diocese has a new leader kansas archbishop joseph naumann under the pope s directive naumann will be the kansas city diocese s apostolic administrator in addition to his regular responsibilities in kansas until a permanent bishop is appointed according to an announcement on the diocese s website i pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the diocese naumann said in an open letter to parishioners all of us who are privileged to serve in leadership for the church do so for only a season it is not our church but christ s church moss the notre dame professor predicted that the shuffling at the western missouri diocese will be very well received though some may question why it took so long it s not just that it s late moss said but it s that francis could have been more explicit to that point the co director of bishopaccountability org asked for more elaboration than the vatican s one line announcement that francis accepted the resignation in accordance with canon law anne doyle from the watchdog group that documents the catholic church s abuse crisis called finn s removal a good step but just the beginning the pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice that it signals a new era in bishop accountability doyle said what no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children s safety his first priority we urge pope francis to issue such a statement immediately cnn s anneclaire stapleton contributed to this report

the arrest and death of freddie gray in baltimore has stoked protests and accusations of police brutality but it s unclear how gray arrested on a weapons charge april suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later here are the big questions surrounding this explosive case gray s arrest what we know gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high crime area of baltimore known for drugs he gave up without the use of force according to baltimore deputy police commissioner jerry rodriguez an officer apparently took his taser out and was prepared to use it on gray but he never deployed it rodriguez said and none of the six officers involved in the arrest describe using force against the year old gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk said rodriguez who described gray as upset and when mr gray was taken out of that van he could not talk and he could not breathe according to rodriguez what we don t know it s unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest and it s also unknown what if anything happened inside the van the knife what we know court documents allege that baltimore police department officer garrett miller arrested gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket the gray family attorney called the allegation a sideshow gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size attorney william murphy told cnn police never saw the knife and chased gray only after he ran from them the attorney said the court documents also say that gray fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket the defendant was arrested without force or incident the documents say the knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife maryland law makes it illegal to wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person including switchblades what we don t know it s not clear that simply having a knife is a crime said baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings blake it is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone so we still have questions she said what can be seen on the released video what we know segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after gray has been arrested and show officers dragging gray who is handcuffed to a van he can be heard screaming he was dragged a bit said rawlings blake but then you see him using his legs to get into the van so he was able bodied when he was in the van and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van he was unresponsive officers placed more restraints on gray inside the van police said while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking that was at a m at a m police called an ambulance for gray police say gray requested medical attention including an inhaler and an ambulance later took him to the university of maryland medical center s shock trauma center what we don t know it s unknown why gray screamed and the video doesn t capture the entire incident start to end it s unclear what happened between a m and a m police response what we know in the wake of gray s death six police officers have been suspended their names were released tuesday a standard procedure after an in custody death said baltimore police department spokesman capt eric kowalczyk it doesn t mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved he said they are lt brian rice who joined the department in officer caesar goodson who joined in sgt alicia white who joined in officer william porter who joined in officer garrett miller who joined in and officer edward nero who joined in police commissioner anthony batts said that authorities plan to conclude their investigation by may their findings will go to the state s attorney s office where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed what we don t know the officers say they didn t use force against gray but that s not certain gray s past run ins with authorities what we know according to court documents cnn obtained there were more than criminal court cases in maryland against gray and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death the cases involve mostly drug related charges but there are charges from march for second degree assault and destruction of property gray was due in court on a possession charge on april he had been in and out of prison since for various drug cases said maryland department of corrections spokesman gerard shields in february he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved gray was paroled on june on april gray was arrested for violating parole but he didn t go back to prison shields said reasoning that whatever gray allegedly did it was something minor gray went back to prison again in may for drug possession and served a month he was released in june what we don t know it s not known whether gray s criminal past had anything to do with his arrest or his death cnn s anneclaire stapleton stephanie gallman and eliott c mclaughlin dana ford and ben brumfield contributed to this report
mountaineers have returned to mount everest for this year s climbing season resuming the quest to summit the world s highest peak after a deadly season last year in the nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell unleashing an avalanche that killed nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers the april accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on mount everest the deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the sherpas and the dangers of climbing everest in order to reduce risks the route through khumbu icefall the notoriously treacherous path where the were killed has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer they re going in the icefall and as we found out on april it s the most dangerous place said conrad anker a veteran climber who has been to everest three times they re exposed to the tumbling ice hanging seracs above it it s very very dangerous it s the most dangerous place i ve been in the mountains at this point in the season climbing teams have not yet entered khumbu icefall which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving nepal has issued permits this year to climb mount everest with of them from the previously shortened season according to the nepal ministry of tourism it s a slight increase from the who were given permission last year the local nepalese committee that determines the path up everest announced in february that a different route had been selected the climbers will now take a central route through the khumbu icefall avoiding the area where the deaths occurred the committee comprised of sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons there will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left said yangji doma sherpa the spokeswoman for the sagarmatha pollution control committee the central route had been used in the s but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route she said the new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses and use more vertical and horizontal ladders the committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders i think it will be an hour longer on the icefall said alan arnette who is blogging from everest base camp this season i don t think it will be game changer but one company alpenglow expeditions said it would stop climbing from the nepal side where the climbers have to go through the icefall in favor of the northern route from china we ve seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years said adrian ballinger the company s founder and ceo we believe the risk is too great for our workers according to the china tibet mountaineering association people have been registered to climb the northern route to everest this year that s more than last year the chinese side of everest has typically been less popular than its nepal counterpart because of concerns of government closures some everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain but it also doesn t have an icefall the increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst nepali companies that climbers will divert to the chinese side i can already see the shift with mountaineers i speak to said dawa steven sherpa who is based in nepal more people are going to go to tibet than nepal nepal needs the tourism far more than china does china has incredible wealth of resources and nepal does not leading expeditions is how sherpas feed their families and send their children to school nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year and while they may be ready to return to the summit their families are not many of them are leaving behind nervous stressed out wives and children whose memories of what happened last year are fresh said dawa sherpa managing director of asian trekking they do say they don t want to put them through that again he said they re not fearful for their own lives it s what they re putting their family through several mountaineers are also returning this year one of them is jon reiter who spoke to cnn last year after the tragedy when the icy avalanche thundered down reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his sherpa guide reiter who is making his way to base camp this year could not be reached directly but he explained why he s heading back to everest this year on his blog i can t quite find the words to tell you why or what really pulls me back to the mountains he wrote when we were in the midst of last year s events it was hard to see the big picture it was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it s more rare than not it was hard for me to remember that i m not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains i like to think it s similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway cnn s

boston cnn dzhokhar tsarnaev s bombs tore through their bodies singeing flesh shattering bones shredding muscles and severing limbs but on tuesday jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead now that he has been found guilty on every count the jury must decide whether boston marathon bomber tsarnaev should live or die for what he has done this is the victim impact part of the case and the testimony was heartbreaking four young people are gone and grief fills the spaces they once occupied a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called princess krystle was the light of my life she was extremely smart hardworking beautiful every father s dream i miss her a lot said william a campbell sr dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter a year old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the boston marathon she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations he said nobody fills that boot now others are expected to come and cry for lingzi lu a jolly soul assistant u s attorney nadine pellegrini said quoting the slain chinese grad student s father more tears will be shed for martin richard who was and looked just like his dad and for sean collier who was remembered at his memorial service by these words big heart big smiles big service all love dzhokhar tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain they had time to be scared and frightened but they had no time to say good bye pellegrini told the jury and that is the very essence of terror timeline of bombings manhunt and aftermath to understand the toll tsarnaev s bombs took jurors must know the stories of his victims the prosecutor said these young women this young man and this little boy all of them were loved and they loved in return pellegrini said before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable they were sons they were daughters they were grandchildren they were brothers and they were sisters jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings there was the photo of campbell as a little girl in a red tap dancing outfit and then came the one that made her father smile through his tears she was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform she traded that in for a bat campbell said she wasn t really a girly girl but she loved to whitewater camp play baseball she had a good arm on her i was very proud of her by contrast jurors also were left with an indelible image of tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held it is dated july the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the boston marathon he glares into the camera defiantly his middle finger raised in a profane salute this is dzhokhar tsarnaev unconcerned unrepentant and unchanged pellegrini said without remorse he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused tsarnaev saw the people he killed as the enemy she said as a result two women and a man never reached the age of and a little boy never made it to the third grade he knew they were innocents he even called them that pellegrini added referring to the message tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings but it didn t stop him from murdering them the people who were maimed by tsarnaev s bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of tsarnaev s trial when the first of the two bombs went off gillian reny a senior in high school was standing near the woman she came to know was krystle campbell there was a complete utter chilling silence and then chaos chaos like i d never seen and never hope to see again she said the force of the blast knocked her to the ground when she looked around she saw blood and muscle everywhere her shin bone had snapped and was protruding muscle was everywhere it was the most horrifying image i could imagine just seeing that on my own body she said and began to cry i remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere blood everywhere were you bleeding she was asked yes enormously looking down at the blood i was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone she said i was terrified that i was going to die i did not know that i could be that injured and survive she said she began to scream her bone chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown doctors were able to save reny s leg but others weren t so lucky celeste corcoran lost both legs one below the

australian prime minister tony abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers his feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others and observers were quick to point out that abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in australia abbott was in a sydney pub on saturday evening when a group of australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them the prime minister accepted and even gave a short impromptu speech one of the football coaches simon carrodus told the australian woman s weekly then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head to toe the entire schooner dribbling little bits on his shirt tipped it upside down on his head and he was proud as punch carrodus said a schooner holds about three quarters of a pint video of abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants skol skol drew plenty of attention on social media some commentators focused on abbott s drinking technique but others suggested he was setting a bad example abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year like most australians i enjoy a drink on social occasions he said in january however as a father and as a citizen i m appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent especially at hot spots in our big cities casting those concerns aside some social media users belittled abbott s beer swilling they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister bob hawke who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in seconds
i usually think of april as tax month but it seems to be morphing into national get tested month dallas mavericks owner mark cuban advised twitterers to have their blood tested for everything available and to do so every three months following her mother s cancer diagnosis singer taylor swift urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests and arizona gov doug ducey signed legislation to allow arizonans to get any lab test without a doctor s order freedom of information always sounds like a good thing but there are many lab tests to order on yourself medicare s clinical diagnostic laboratory fee schedule lists over a thousand they are not all blood tests but a lot of them are and since blood tests require blood you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr cuban s advice to get them all anemia a frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the test me market in those states that allow it and over half do laboratories are offering walk in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values and if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business check out the franchise opportunities at any labtest now fastest labs and all labtests fast some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society but the primary effect won t be more health but rather more medical care fundamentally well people will appear in doctors offices with abnormal results abnormalities are common in normal people as we learned when whole body ct scanning was in vogue a decade ago thankfully only briefly so doctors will increasingly face one of two options take the time to reassure these new patients that their results aren t really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms or it will confirm the presence of abnormality most of which will be minor abnormalities often it won t be clear what to do but doctors will be pressed to do something that s when the real problems begin will anybody be helped maybe will anybody be hurt definitely the disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better but it s not that hard for us to make them feel worse decades of research have shown that there are real side effects to testing the well more anxiety that can t be good for your health more procedures which often involve needles pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs and more treatment for disease not destined to cause problems as in over a million additional american men treated for prostate cancer ditto women for breast cancer to see how far wrong testing can go check out south korea where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer and thyroid cancer surgery by fold i can tell you one thing for sure the freedom to test won t save money sure a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests but advertising will drive up the volume of testing and then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results this will cost people real money either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out of pocket costs maybe this kind of freedom of information isn t such a good thing of course there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems but if you feel well don t think that testing will make you feel better the biotech sector is excited about testing well people it s a huge market and is developing lots of new product now you can sequence your dna soon you will be able to monitor your immune system s signature now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app they are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer a breast cancer monitoring bra i can t make this stuff up should we outlaw an individual s freedom to test no we don t need another victimless crime but it is certainly an area that demands regulation the food and drug administration has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing it s also an area that demands education the public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful that doesn t mean they are routinely useful abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people it is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean much less what to do about the results freedom is a good thing but feel free not to exercise your freedoms just as carrying a gun doesn t necessarily make you any safer testing yourself doesn t necessarily make you any healthier
billboard considering the academy of country music awards celebrated its th anniversary on sunday night at the dallas cowboys stadium it was bound to be bigger than any previous year s acms plus as hosts blake shelton and luke bryan were quick to point out everything is bigger in texas billboard acm awards see all the photos but bigger isn t always better here s our breakdown of the best and worst moments at the acms the best eric church keith urban provide an opening wallop with a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching two of country s leading men successfully lit the fuse for the th annual acm awards with a slick joint kickoff performance eric church s pledge allegiance to the hag was a fine throwback but keith urban s powerhouse raise em up lived up to its title and then some setting a guinness world record not only was this the acms biggest audience ever but the acm awards brought in the biggest audience for a live tv awards show ever now that s how you celebrate half a century reba mcentire demonstrates how it s done during a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department reba mcentire showed the entire cowboys stadium and many younger singers who don t have half her energy how it s done reba is eternal taylor swift singing in the audience whether it was during eric church or martina mcbride t swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples taylor might have gone pop for but she was deep in the heart of texas for this annual country extravaganza billboard acm awards and the winners are garth brooks all american salute during brooks performance of all american kid the country giant welcomed a slew of u s military representatives into at t stadium in an emotional moment that put the red white and blue front and center brooks ended the performance by saluting the u s armed forces who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom and also shouted out his home state of oklahoma who are grieving years after the oklahoma city bombing on sunday a truly classy moment from one of the best ever taylor swift s mom makes an appearance sure andrea swift s presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of love story and some lovely words about the year old superstar but the sight of the elder swift just days after taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night s most poignant moments christina aguilera joins rascal flatts aguilera is far from country but with a voice as malleable as hers she can pass for a song or two after singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on nashville xtina joined longtime hitmakers rascal flatts for riot from their recent album rewind aguilera and gary levox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked miranda lambert domination in addition to kicking ass during her mama s broken heart little red wagon medley lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards if there s one thing the country community loves more than miranda lambert it s giving miranda lambert awards billboard watch little big town bring provocative girl crush to acms little big town don t back down despite some mild controversy over their song girl crush little big town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show giving the acms one of its more melancholy moments jason aldean comes on strong for a night featuring some shaky vocals aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the acms during a massive medley it s hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you re watching at home but it s fair to assume that s what happened during his performance the worst tony romo the dallas cowboys qb was understandably a little stiff on the mic athletes usually aren t the most charismatic public speakers but the whole gag with shelton asking romo to toss bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long on the plus side bryan caught the pass on the other hand there was a tired play on words about balls the length three hours for the th acms sure why not three and a half hours that s pushing it they could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks all of the milestone awards taylor swift was given an extended honor at this year s acm awards but some of the milestone awards especially those given to reba mcentire kenny chesney and george strait seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting it s understandable since is the th anniversary of the acms but sometimes less recipients is more steven tyler s facial hair see link twitter calling out taylor swift plenty of country fans went after t swizzle on twitter berating her for attending the acms after abandoning country music for pop the truth is swift has just as many country classics under her belt as any other artist in her age range she might have moved to pop but don t underplay her importance to the genre that birthed her billboard all

the question how can i know if my food is safe to eat after a specific product recall the answer many of us shed a few tears over the recent sabra hummus recall even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf to assuage any fears we asked john swartzberg m d a clinical professor at the university of california at berkeley to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat related amy s kitchen recalls more than cases of food due to fear of listeria contamination the first step according to swartzberg is to go to the food and drug administration s website and find the official report for the recalled product you re worried about each report will list recalled items with their product codes which are typically categorized by the universal product code the number adjacent to the barcode or the stock keeping unit a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold they will also include the recalled products use by dates and the geographical areas affected the recall is not based on the use by dates though said swartzberg if the product is within the use by date it should still be recalled this makes sense because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how fresh the product is it still may be contaminated after cross checking these details you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away but as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage related habits of people with a healthy relationship to food there s nothing the consumer can do prior to learning about the recall said dr swartzberg discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done in the case of this specific hummus recall while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness the product s routine sample last month revealed the presence of listeria monocytogenes consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis a serious infection and dr swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible listeria survives well at cool temperatures he said most bacteria and fungi do not that s why we refrigerate healthy people are at low risk for disease but it can happen those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly immunocompromised and pregnant to learn more about the best food safety practices visit uc berkeley s wellness website related things nutrition experts wish you would stop saying about food

different so watch for that to continue said zeleny those youtube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race the liberals love them the obama factor clinton finds a lot to love and some distance hillary clinton is a big fan of president obama s health care law but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style so reports ap s lisa lerer who was in iowa this past week for the clinton campaign rollout and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime obama rival who of course went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state she embraced key portions of his legacy coming out strong for the health care law for his push for immigration legislation but it wasn t all sunshine and light said lerer she also took subtle digs at his leadership style she said america was on the wrong track i can t believe i m saying this but at times she sounded almost like a republican in big policy choice clinton signals an important campaign focus in democratic politics kamala is the harris sister who gets the most national buzz but maya harris is about to play a big role in the question of how hillary clinton plots her path to electoral votes kamala harris is the california attorney general and a senate candidate for the seat being vacated by democrat barbara boxer maya harris just signed on for a top policy role in the clinton campaign and cnn s nia malika henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message one clue i think is maya harris said henderson her resume is really a liberal s dream she has worked at the center for american progress aclu she s also done work on community policing and police reforming and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate so i think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that hillary clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color who are so crucial to getting the obama coalition back together again walker rubio rubio walker a general contrast with some gop buzz marco rubio drew a direct generational contrast with hillary clinton when he officially joined the gop race and wisconsin gov scott walker also often talks of his hope republicans will look for a next generation leader as their next presidential nominee in political circles meaning among junkies and strategists there is constant debate about potential tickets at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail but jonathan martin of the new york times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a walker rubio pairing is not limited to inside the beltway chatter they both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that clinton and gore did in said martin but what s interesting is in new hampshire over the weekend i was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates for the first time from an actual activist not an operative but an activist i heard somebody float the idea of a walker rubio race in iowa new hampshire south carolina and then heading into the cycle the republican national committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front loaded now some big gop establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe especially texas sen ted cruz iowa new hampshire and south carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar florida is usually the next big contest but it could be eclipsed by sports fans will get this what is becoming known as the sec primary it is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress but what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a super tuesday or maybe back to back tuesdays in early march that include a number of conservative southern states alabama arkansas tennessee texas georgia maybe louisiana the shift is one reason former arkansas gov mike huckabee thinks the environment could be more favorable to him than ditto for rick santorum they did well in the south but it didn t matter much because john mccain and mitt romney respectively were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted again there might yet be more changes but more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites people like jeb bush or marco rubio and helping those with strong evangelical connections like huckabee and cruz
if i had to describe the u s iranian relationship in one word it would be overmatched we re playing checkers on the middle east game board and tehran s playing three dimensional chess iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices all the while convincing ourselves that america s policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track iran isn t feet tall in this region but by making the nuclear issue the be all and end all that is supposed to reduce iran s power the united states is only making tehran taller consider the following the u s iranian relationship is not symmetrical it s not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors iran is about to try a u s citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from iran s serial abuse of human rights including the behavior of its shia militias in iraq i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind the scenes plan to have iran release jason rezaian if not we re legitimizing a bad regime and compromising u s values and interests in the process by not ensuring that all americans being held by iran come out as part of the nuclear deal america is alienating some of our closest allies because of the iran deal and iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see iran s power rising our friends aren t perfect particularly the saudis and even the israelis but we need them precisely because iran is rising sadly the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities in the meantime iran s allies bashar al assad s syria hezbollah and now the houthis not proxies but instruments of convenience see what s happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the iranian game the russians too realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency we re losing friends iran is gaining them and in one of the cruelest ironies iran s way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah the nuclear issue as the arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power egypt iraq syria iran is rising the argument here is not that iran is taking over the middle east but in its zone of influence a zone critical to the united states syria iraq the gulf yemen lebanon it is expanding its influence not contracting washington doesn t play this kind of game well it is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat isis in syria and yet not empower al assad no answer how to combat isis in iraq without favoring the shia dominated government and alienating iraqi sunnis no answer and how to backstop the saudis in yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes no answer iran has a much easier time managing contradictions indeed it can use the threat of isis to keep the americans away from weakening their ally al assad as well as expand its influence in iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest battle group naval assets to the gulf of aden notwithstanding the united states is being outfoxed not outgunned don t expect u s ships to stop those of iran as state department spokesperson marie harf said there are reports about these u s ships that have been moved and i want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression they are not there to intercept iranian ships the purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe i think there was some misreporting and confusion on this i just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those iranian ships it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain iran s nuclear program but we should have no illusions about two things first we won t end teheran s nuclear weapons pretensions and two we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy not constraining it one of the reasons the united states won t strike al assad is for fear of emboldening isis but the other is that we don t want a proxy war with iran in syria as the russians have made clear in their recent s deal the nuclear negotiations are only making iran a more acceptable business partner and the real fruits of the diplomacy haven t even begun yet sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up not tamp down their regional aspirations we ve made our bed apparently and now are going to have to find a way to sleep a nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now but unless it really does change iran s behavior we ve only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road
south america s atacama desert one of the driest places on earth resembles some of the faraway planets monitored by giant telescopes there the lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe it is pure visual silence said photographer andres figueroa it is amazing there is absolutely no humidity and these conditions create some striking contrasts there in that clear inhospitably arid environment figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology one rooted in the ancient folklore of the andean people taking along his mobile lighting studio figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every july in the atacama in his dancers of the deserts series figueroa chronicles these festivals which attract about people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in chile i have always wanted to see the desert even though i am not very religious i ve always been curious about their traditions said figueroa who is from the chilean capital of santiago figueroa worked hard on cataloging and differentiating the ceremonies and their complex rituals at times playing the role of an artist others as an anthropologist but he always remained faithful to his love for classic portraiture from an anthropological standpoint i was interested in documenting all the signs and symbols that appear in each costume and character all the indigenous and catholic syncretism he said my lighting studio allowed me to pick up on these details from a portraiture standpoint i used a formal approach to explain this living culture that is constantly growing and reinventing itself i asked each character to stop to be photographed taking them away momentarily from the festival in a more intimate scenario photographing adobe walls desert landscapes and the ubiquitous camping sites where pilgrims come to gather figueroa said each character is perched in his or her own context social media follow cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography bears and devils pose in the desert in striking contrast these photos highlight the uniqueness of andean culture which draws influences from europe the inca and more recently chinese traditions there are endless nuances not always perceived by the naked eye it is a very special festival when you see the bears you see them participating in the different roles blending in with the the devils figueroa said and sometimes you see them as a central figure in a festival of their own it is amazing a tradition brought by the chinese near peru figueroa who befriended many of the musicians and dancers said it was important to take part in the festival in order to understand its meaning to the community i had to understand the hierarchy and protocols of each group he said as a photographer it is important to create the conditions for things to happen you can have it all planned and set up in order for things to naturally take place figueroa said the desert festivals have a deeper role in a region that struggles with social problems such as drug trafficking and poverty it is the glue that binds families and young people heavily invest their time and money to make their costumes and parade with pride the festivals are a form of social protection figueroa said i felt the presence of love their love and effort in communicating with their divinity and holding together as communities andres figueroa is a chilean photographer you can follow him on facebook

italians have a saying too much of something cripples it we re overcrowded with so many frescoed churches medieval castles and roman ruins that we simply don t know what to do with them let alone care for a proper upkeep we ve turned blind to their value and beauty there are nearly gems scattered across the country ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments italy boasts the highest number of unesco world heritage sites in the world several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources and there are another that are at the mercy of mudslides floods and natural calamities the unesco listed basilica of assisi where st frances tomb lies is just the last of a series of national shames its frescoed walls by renaissance masters including giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle in a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise euros we re talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world not to mention its artistic value i remember once an american colleague asking me but what does italy do with its immense cultural heritage good question if other nations had half as much of what we boast they d make a much better job with it paradoxically if we had just the coliseum or venice it would be easier but we don t and trouble is italy doesn t know how to exploit this treasure take the british museum s successful exhibition on pompeii in we have the real site in our backyard but the british made the best of it worldwide while the real pompeii was and still is making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses or worse italy couldn t care less to promote its assets as a travel writer i have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it s a battle many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places i find myself almost begging them when it should be the other way round the true but sad thing is that restyling in italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors crowdfunding has already saved bologna s san luca portico the coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand todd s while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts yet it s not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity driven measures it s also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment the care to cherish a country s valuable monuments and that s because italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging italy despite its millenary history is one of the world s most modern states unified in patriot massimo d azeglio once said now that we ve made italy we need to make italians tough job indeed and we re still a long way to go there s also wide spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general heritage authorities are in love with the romantic ideal of decadent ruins better leave the monument or site as it is even allow it to rot rather than recover it and destroy its original beauty each time new subway works bring to light an unknown roman theatre or necropoli it all freezes the public works and the artistic upkeep preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion but that s a blind approach there s so much italy could do with what it has that it could live off tourism symbola foundation estimates that culture and art if well exploited could generate a turnover of billion euros a year amounting to of gdp another thorny issue is having a cheap culture entrance tickets to the coliseum italy s top site that each year lures more than million tourists cost a maximum of euros matera s rock crypts are euros not to mention churches featuring michelangelo s works which are free to enter the first time i visited westminster abbey in london and st patrick s church in dublin i was shocked to find out i had to pay to get in and it was quite expensive too one could argue that italy does well to open for free the lord s doors but probably in some critical cases a minimum cost to enter wouldn t hurt the country s mindset needs to change too monuments and works of art are not dead but living things that deserve to be sexed up once in a while if we don t have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance why not give them over to other countries to run or sell them to rich businessmen similar options make state authorities hair stand on end they stress art belongs to the italian people and should remain in public hands even if it s inaccessible and unenjoyable yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private thriving multimedia museum the uffizi galleries secret cellars are stacked with forgotten masterpieces which could be leased out to privates curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved but cobwebs and dust can do no harm right our sunny piazzas bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities coffers and who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo there are also abandoned medieval ghost towns that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy the state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for years since the project launch in so far just two restyles have worked out one being a renaissance villa in florence turned into a deluxe spa resort fine rome wasn t built in a day but it could crumble in an hour
if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself the answer of course would be no yet for decades many have stood by the belief that such programs known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs promote and encourage drug use indeed for congress it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs but an overwhelming body of scientific evidence continues to show that this is simply not true as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again and this time scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two blood borne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes this is a welcome step an estimated americans are newly infected with hiv every year and some are among injection drug users meanwhile between and at least states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates with more than half reporting at least a increase in acute infections among young adults overall the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under rose from to in six years with such numbers in mind the recent national spotlight on syringe services programs offers a critical opportunity for us to reignite a much needed conversation dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against hiv and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes without increasing drug use in addition to helping curb the spread of these diseases by offering access to sterile syringes these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets and protecting law enforcement personnel and others including children from injuries they also offer preventive health services such as hiv testing and counseling and form vital bridges to drug treatment overdose prevention housing and employment services for states such as new york and washington early adopters of these interventions syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down hiv transmission among injecting drug users washington was the first state in the united states to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in tacoma in in new york city where half of all injection drug users were hiv positive in the s state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in to combat the disease deeming it a public health necessity the expansion of these programs in new york was followed by a dramatic reduction in hiv incidence among injecting drug users declining from in to in hepatitis c prevalence declined from to during this period because they work syringe services programs will likely be an integral part of the statewide plans announced by new york gov andrew cuomo and washington gov jay inslee to reduce new hiv infections dramatically by syringe exchange programs not only save lives but also save millions of dollars in hiv treatment costs while a clean syringe costs less than cents the average lifetime cost of treating an hiv positive person is estimated to be around as hiv positive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness public programs such as medicaid will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs for example an analysis by johns hopkins university researchers showed that expanding the availability of syringe services programs to cover just of all injections in the united states would prevent almost new hiv infections among drug users per year this translates into million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated million investment in other words every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between and in hiv treatment costs alone despite such evidence syringe services programs are continually caught in the political crossfire a longstanding ban temporarily lifted in and then reinstated by congress as part of budget negotiations prevents state and local jurisdictions from spending their federal health dollars on these programs lifting the ban will not cost any additional money it simply allows states to spend their federally allocated dollars on syringe services programs if they choose to do so why is this important the federal government provides the majority of funding for all hiv prevention services without access to federal funding more than syringe service programs in states washington d c and puerto rico are operating on shoestring budgets from local and state governments this has forced syringe services programs across the country to cut staff scale down services and potentially shut their doors for good meanwhile the new hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in primarily rural states such as in indiana or kentucky show that the landscape of injection drug use in america is rapidly changing we have a chance right now to get ahead of the curve and avert a nationwide resurgence of hiv and hepatitis c infections through injection drug use it is time for congress to make sound and effective policy based upon facts rather than discredited assertions or unsubstantiated fears

too little too late that s the mayor s response to an artist s apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the scary lucy statue that has put the new york town of celoron in the spotlight this week the bronze figure of comedian and area native lucille ball has elicited comparisons to a walking dead zombie and inspired the facebook campaign we love lucy get rid of this statue the sculpture a gift to the town from its original owners has been on display since artist dave poulin has had plenty of opportunity to step forward and our last conversation he wanted to celoron mayor scott schrecengost said and then he stated that if we didn t have the funds and we didn t like the statue we should take it down and put it in storage after the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend poulin publicly apologized monday for his most unsettling sculpture in a letter to the hollywood reporter i take full responsibility for scary lucy though by no means was that my intent or did i wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic lucy image poulin wrote in the letter pdf from the day of its installation i have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture not befitting of lucy s beauty or my ability as a sculptor poulin said he has been talking to celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture it seems that cost has been the chief barrier it puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community they accept it and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense poulin wrote in the letter but the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind i am willing to put my time and money into redoing the lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years i can do a much better job poulin wrote no thanks schrecengost said he said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue it would be reworked from the shoulders up the entire head neck and shoulders not just the face schrecengost said in a news release tuesday the town has set up a post office box for donations which can also be made through kickstarter but the controversy may not be over it seems that nearby jamestown new york also has ties to lucille ball s early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend schrecengost s tuesday statement referred to an anonymous facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising jamestown s lucille ball profile at the expense of the celoron statue the best place for a life size statue of lucy is right where it is now in lucille ball memorial park in her hometown in the village of celoron ny he said cnn s emanuella grinberg contributed to this story

erika langhart had a zest for life by the time she finished college she had already visited countries after graduating from college she was working in washington and thinking about going to law school her life was full of promise but all that ended suddenly when she was just years old in phoenix karen langhart was looking forward to her daughter coming home for thanksgiving when she received a call from erika s cell phone in an interview with cnn erika s mom said she picked up the phone and answered it hi schmoo can t wait to see you schmoo bear is our nickname for her and it was sean with groceries in hand erika s boyfriend sean coakley had arrived at her apartment to make dinner and found erika collapsed on the floor the fire department and paramedics were already on the scene the attendant at the front desk had heard erika screaming for help and called the paramedics tried to revive her with cpr and while they were in the apartment i think she had a heart attack and then two more on the way to the hospital in the ambulance and another one in the hospital and she never woke up erika s father rick langhart said karen knew it was serious when the emergency room doctor said they needed to come to the hospital in arlington virginia she said the doctor asked her whether erika was using any birth control according to karen when she told him erika was using the nuvaring he said well there s a link between nuvaring and pulmonary embolisms karen langhart said rick langhart said doctors removed the nuvaring immediately it was it was a nightmare he added by the time rick and karen arrived at the virginia hospital center erika was in a coma in the icu they had determined that erika had no brain activity and that because of her heart attacks they basically told us that she was brain dead and that s it rick langhart said fighting back tears hospital records cited the nuvaring as a risk factor for erika s multiple pulmonary embolisms records confirm what erika s parents told cnn that a blood clot started in an artery vein in her right thigh and traveled to her lungs causing massive pulmonary embolisms and multiple episodes of cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and overnight the langharts never heard their daughter s voice again she died on thanksgiving we miss her so much karen langhart said less than a year later miles away in utah megan henry had the scare of her life henry it turns out was a classmate of erika langhart s at american university she s training to compete in the olympics in skeleton a type of high speed downhill sledding the scare that shook her in august threatened her olympic dreams within weeks of starting the nuvaring henry said she collapsed during training unable to breathe i mean i was struggling i was struggling to breathe henry said it s like an elephant was sitting on my chest all the time after seeing five doctors who were unable to tell her what was wrong she finally got a diagnosis from a pulmonologist he told her he thought she had blood clots in her lungs i said you know i started taking this birth control is it related to this henry said and he was like yeah i definitely think that you have blood clots and it s from the birth control x rays followed by an ultrasound and a cat scan revealed that megan s life was in danger the doctor started to tell me you have multiple pulmonary embolisms in both lungs said megan they re sending an ambulance they re going to come and they re going to rush you to the emergency room it just really took me by surprise and you know i knew it was something bad but i never imagined it would be something like that according to her hospital discharge papers the nuvaring henry was using was probably the risk factor for her pulmonary embolisms henry went from peak physical condition to using a breathing machine she was put on blood thinners too her doctors told her it s too risky to use hormonal birth control again easy safe that s really how it was presented easy safe low dose hormone you know and it turns out it wasn t it wasn t that at all she said even though nuvaring has about the same risk for blood clots as newer birth control pills henry said she wishes she had known that the incidence of life threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring compared to older birth control pills there are other options out there for birth control that have risks but not doubling the risks henry told cnn if i would have known that i never would have taken it and thinking about what happened to her classmate erika henry said i think if i knew what i know now and you know if erika had known that a number of people i think that they would have made a slightly different choice the nuvaring is one of the most popular birth control products on the market a flexible ring inserted vaginally it releases a combination of hormones by as many as women were using the vaginal ring as a contraceptive method according to the guttmacher institute a nonprofit organization advancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide at least million women use hormonal birth control pills the nuvaring was approved by the fda in and became available to women in the united states in the dutch pharmaceutical company organon developed the device and manufactured it until when the company was sold to schering plough corporation which was then acquired by merck in according to merck the nuvaring is sold in more than countries and million prescriptions have been filled for women in the united states alone the nuvaring dispenses what s called a third generation progestin or synthetic hormone when it first came on the market the device was touted as a breakthrough inserted vaginally to release a continuous low dose of hormones it stays in for three weeks so no bother of taking a daily birth control pill the ring was branded in a television commercial as a different way to do birth control and oh it s easy to use convenient absolutely but safe that depends on whom you ask the langharts had no idea the nuvaring birth control their daughter had been using for four years had already been linked to other women s deaths according to unconfirmed claims of problems reported to the fda merck acknowledges a very small risk of blood clots but stands by its product saying there is substantial evidence to support the safety and efficacy of nuvaring while studies have shown that the number of severe adverse events is extremely low fewer than cases per women who use it for a year the families who have lost loved ones point out that the incidence of life threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring than with older birth control pills since the mid s there have been multiple studies suggesting that while third generation progestins are generally safe they are approximately twice as likely to cause blood clots than older second generation birth control pills merck denied cnn s request for an on camera interview instead it gave this statement while there is a very small risk of a blood clot when using nuvaring or any combined hormonal contraceptive this risk is much less than the risk of blood clots during pregnancy and the immediate post partum period among women between five and women run the risk of developing a serious blood clot during pregnancy the risk increases to between and women during the week postpartum period among women in a year using combination hormonal contraceptives that includes birth control pills the ring and the patch the risk of developing serious blood clots ranges between three and women nuvaring users are on the higher end of that risk two studies conducted in and reveal the risk of developing a serious blood clot among nuvaring users is and per women in a year respectively the nuvaring s label was updated in by the fda with information about both studies the langharts megan henry and others sued merck according to claims filed in federal and state courts the lawsuits allege organon the original manufacturer of the nuvaring failed to adequately warn consumers about a heightened risk of blood clots associated with the use of nuvaring even though the manufacturer was aware that nuvaring posed greater risks than other hormonal contraceptives in february without admitting any wrongdoing merck agreed to pay million in damages but the langharts did not settle insisting merck be held accountable for what the family said was merck s failure to properly warn users of the risk they believe what merck is getting away with is criminal i don t understand why a company in the united states would allow that kind of product on the market it s not the way americans do business rick langhart said and for them to do what they do in total disregard for what s going on it s criminal to me instead to honor erika s memory they decided to create a nonprofit to inform women of the dangers they believe are related to the nuvaring and the comparative risks of all forms of hormonal contraceptives the nonprofit s name informed choice for amerika honors their daughter s name

if one is to believe lawyers for aaron hernandez the former new england patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend his future brother in law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain smoked the jury in the high profile trial resumed deliberations wednesday after deliberating about an hour and a half on tuesday the way defense lawyer james sultan laid it out for the massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier tuesday why would a young man with a million contract kill semi pro player odin lloyd less than a mile from his own home why would hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene did those who sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the national football league if there was evidence of any reason aaron would have had to murder odin loyd don t you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks sultan asked the jury you didn t hear it because it doesn t exist the prosecution however portrayed hernandez as cold calculating and insecure a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others prosecutor william mccauley asked jurors what was hernandez talking about a day after lloyd s bullet riddled body was found at a massachusetts industrial park in june my endorsements are gone hernandez said according to mccauley said he s not talking about odin the state s largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than witnesses and the presentation of more than pieces of evidence on monday hernandez s defense gave its side of the story in less than a day in closing arguments the next day sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt even if they found a strong likelihood that hernandez was involved the lawyer said that s not enough sultan tried to implicate hernandez s co defendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately the defense described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp as men capable of killing someone in drug induced fits of rage they re accused of killing lloyd did he make all the right decisions no sultan said of his client he was a year old kid who witnessed something committed by somebody he knew he really didn t know what to do so he put one foot in front of another keep in mind he s not charged with accessory after the fact he s charged with murder and that he did not do the prosecution said wallace and ortiz were longtime friends of hernandez who had complete control of them mccauley reminded the jury of testimony about hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying drinking smoothies and hernandez at times leaving his then month old child with the two men these guys will do whatever he wants the prosecutor said of hernandez the motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out but prosecutors said lloyd might have done or said something that didn t sit well with hernandez they said hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score mccauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone such as disrespect would easily offend hernandez hernandez s fiancee shayanna jenkins testified that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple s home that she said reeked of marijuana she also said she didn t know what was in the box the prosecution has said the murder weapon which has not been recovered was in the box after concealing the box with her daughter s clothing jenkins said she threw it away in a random dumpster but could not remember where another piece of the state s case was grainy footage from hernandez s home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a caliber handgun the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park which is about a mile from hernandez s home the video is time stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving hernandez s lawyers showed a different part of the video time stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand they suggested it was an ipad evidence collected in lloyd s death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub that double shooting took place in july almost a year before lloyd was killed he will be tried in that case after the lloyd trial the jury has not heard about the double shooting cnn s susan candiotti and laura dolan contributed to this report

i ve been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event as the boston marathon runners begin and hopefully finish their exhausting run monday the lingering memories of the marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways more public safety officials throughout the route a finish line area that prohibits large bags national guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security those are the most obvious visible changes and there are less obvious ones too with the luxury of some time and healing the city has moved on and that is a blessing in the midst of that weeklong tragedy the bombings the manhunt the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the tsarnaev brothers we thought we knew what was going on but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness the fog of war sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions that narrative is just forming and it s worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week as a former homeland security adviser for massachusetts i was intimately involved with the marathon planning as a commentator for cnn i saw the story evolve during that week some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight others by various after action reports and assessments and others by the trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts on tuesday the trial s sentencing phase will begin determining whether he will receive the death penalty in national security circles there is often a debate about whether the u s judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials terrorism the argument goes is different from traditional crimes and our system of evidence and cross examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats even if this argument were valid in some context where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain the boston marathon trial made clear that the system does work what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional prosecutors presented evidence defense attorneys challenged the witnesses the defendant chose not to testify a verdict was rendered its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases but also took the mythology maybe even the romanticism of terrorism out of the case it rendered tsarnaev a common criminal and that was a statement worth making recent reports about the shootout in watertown that friday night in show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of massachusetts transit police officer richard donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure maybe it was adrenaline maybe it was just the nature of the weapons what is clear in watertown and in so many other police departments is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now that is a dangerous gap and too many police departments are failing to address it we have a notion of boston strong coming from the attacks and the city s response i never loved the term mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have puritan stock and a kick ass attitude that is only partially true we risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a keep calm persona i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response the quick decisions to move runners off boylston street the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only one part of the response that doesn t get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks runners had no access to phones and often had no identification family members of runners often didn t know where their loved ones were on the marathon route first responders in particular the boston police and the red cross focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to commonwealth avenue a few blocks from the finish line once family members know that they are with loved ones the trauma subsides they often leave the scene freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster is my family ok obviously there is so much more to learn could the bombing have been avoided what would have happened if the fbi had shared information it had on the tsarnaev family with local police what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers it s woulda coulda shoulda but still essential one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isn t simply for blame but to get better for the next time analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient but do not believe that we are done learning looking back can be risky it s often called the blinding clarity of hindsight because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror but i have no doubt that at future anniversaries what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead

rolling stone one summer a few years ago frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone frances the daughter of nirvana singer guitarist kurt cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life kurt cobain montage of heck was a year old goth kid so stoked she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of kurt yeah frances says with a grin and mock exasperation looking at my dad every day preview the cover story and listen to a previously unheard cobain song here that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march as frances now and a visual artist speaks publicly for the first time about her father life after his death her complex relationship with her mother courtney love and the new film written directed and produced by brett morgen kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art because the world demanded it of him frances says bluntly at one point i think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he didn t want to be here and everyone would be happier without him rolling stone listen to a previously unheard kurt cobain song but in reality if he had lived she goes on i would have had a dad and that would have been an incredible experience what follows are additional excerpts from a remarkable and moving conversation how would you describe montage of heck it s emotional journalism it s the closest thing to having kurt tell his own story in his own words by his own aesthetic his own perception of the world it paints a portrait of a man attempting to cope with being a human when brett and i first met i was very specific about what i wanted to see how i wanted kurt to be represented i told him i don t want the mythology of kurt or the romanticism even though kurt died in the most horrific way possible there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him because he s forever the shelf life of an artist or musician isn t particularly long kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age he will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful rolling stone young innovators shaking up the music industry there is with any great artist a little manic ness and insanity tropic of cancer is one of my favorite books and author henry miller had this work ethic where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages it taught me that if you do the work you progress so many people are content to settle my dad was exceptionally ambitious but he had a lot thrown on him exceeding his ambition he wanted his band to be successful but he didn t want to be the f voice of a generation do you remember the first time you heard a nirvana record and knowing that was your father i ve talked to sean lennon about this he had a few more years with his dad that you did but for him the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone i don t really like nirvana that much grins sorry promotional people universal i m more into mercury rev oasis brian jonestown massacre laughs the grunge scene is not what i m interested in but territorial pissings on nevermind is a f great song and dumb on in utero i cry every time i hear that song it s a stripped down version of kurt s perception of himself of himself on drugs off drugs feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation rolling stone elton john michael stipe defend transgender prisoners rights the irony is that he wrote it before nirvana made nevermind i know it was projection to something there s no way anyone can wrap their minds around that did you feel awkward as a teenager not being that interested in the music kurt made no i would have felt more awkward if i d been a fan i was around when i realized he was inescapable even if i was in a car and had the radio on there s my dad he s larger than life and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians we love to put them on a pedestal if kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible but he wasn t he inspired people to put him on a pedestal to become st kurt he became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive you don t think it could have gotten any bigger but it did after the first screening i attended there was a guy who said montage of heck was a very interesting film about people he didn t like laughs that s a pretty good description rolling stone a guide to cobain s cinematic legacy i found it interesting that the way morgen told kurt s story didn t evoke any sympathy for that viewer that kurt s art did not resonate with him all he saw was a personalty he didn t like that is an interesting perspective for me the film provided a lot more factual information about my father not just tall tales that were misconstrued misremembered rehashed retold different ways it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child as a teenager as a man as a husband as an artist it explored every single aspect of who he was as a human being what was it like hearing his voice i ve been hearing his voice forever through his music i was thinking more of his speaking voice his speaking voice is sort of similar to mine it s sort of a monotone the depth to it is similar to the way i speak i don t know what the f that is i wasn t even talking when he was around don t mistake the power of genes it s very weird how genes are dave grohl krist novoselic and pat smear came over to a house where i was living it was the first time the ex nirvana members had been together in a long time and they had what i call the k c jeebies which is when they see me they see kurt they look at me and you can see they re looking at a ghost they were all getting the k c jeebies hardcore dave said she is so much like kurt they were all talking amongst themselves rehashing old stories i d heard a million times i was sitting in a chair chain smoking looking down like this affects total boredom and they went you are doing exactly what your father would have done but i was glad they came over smiles it was a cool experience like having a nirvana reunion minus one except for his spawn what do you want to do next now that this film is coming out in being one of the executive producers you re stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made nirvana s first album the timing is i like to think of it as poetic coincidental yeah oddly enough being it s the first year a fire has been lit under my ass not because of the documentary just personally i have this motivation and ambition that i didn t have before i want to go paint this painting the hardest part of doing anything creatively is just

marine life seen swimming in unusual places water temperatures warmer than they should be no snow where there should be feet of it some scientists are saying the blob could be playing a factor as monikers go the blob doesn t sound very worrisome but if you re a salmon fisherman in washington or a california resident hoping to see the end of the drought the blob could become an enemy of top concern a university of washington climate scientist and his associates have been studying the blob a huge area of unusually warm water in the pacific for months in the fall of and early we started to notice a big almost circular mass of water that just didn t cool off as much as it usually did so by spring of it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year said nick bond who works at the joint institute for the study of the atmosphere and ocean in seattle washington bond who gave the blob its name said it was miles long miles wide and yards deep in and it has grown this year and it s not the only one there are two others that emerged in nate mantua of the southwest fisheries science center part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa said in september one is in the bering sea and the other is off the coast of southern california waters in the blob have been warmer by about degrees a significant rise a recent set of studies published in geophysical research letters by bond s group points to a high pressure ridge over the west coast that has calmed ocean waters for two winters the result was more heat staying in the water because storms didn t kick up and help cool the surface water the warmer temperatures we see now aren t due to more heating but less winter cooling a recent news release from the university of washington announcing the studies said the university has worked with noaa on the research according to new scientist magazine some marine species are exploring the warmer waters leading some fish to migrate hundreds of miles from their normal habitats the magazine cited fisherman and wildlife officials in alaska who have seen skipjack tuna and thresher sharks pygmy killer whales have been spotted off the coast of washington i ve never seen some of these species here before bill peterson of the northwest fisheries science center in seattle told the new scientist and he was worried about the adult pacific salmon that normally feed on tiny crustaceans and other food sources that are not around in the same numbers off the coast of the pacific northwest they had nothing to eat he told the magazine of last year s conditions in the blob it appears that food has moved to cooler waters in january bond told the chinook observer in long beach washington that his concern is for very young salmon that are still upstream in particular the year class that would be going to sea next spring he said noaa said in a news release last month that california sea lion pups have been found extremely underweight and dying possibly because of an ocean with fewer things to eat we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches justin greenman assistant stranding coordinator for noaa on the west coast told cnn the numbers are overwhelming facilities that care for the stranded sea lions most of whom are pups local officials said record number of sea lion pups stranded in california the blob also is affecting life on land for the past few years that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the west dry and warm exacerbating the drought in california oregon and washington one of the primary problems is small snow accumulation in the mountains in early april officials measured the snowpack in california at a time when it should be the highest this year it hit an all time low at inches of water content in the snow just of the annual average the previous low for april had been in and pdf gov jerry brown in announcing water restrictions the same day stood on a patch of dry brown grass in the sierra nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to feet of snow low california snowpack ushers mandatory water restrictions the heat has caused rising air which can lead to conditions that produce more thunderstorms with warmer air in california areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead that has led to the lower snowpack and helped compound the drought the storms also mean more lightning and more wildfires and the blob affects people on other areas of the country that same persistent jet stream pattern has allowed cold air to spill into much of the midwest and east this stuck pattern has led to the record cold and snow in the midwest and northeast over the last two seasons with record snows we have seen in boston and detroit and the most snow we have seen in decades for cities such as chicago the weather pattern is confusing the experts there are some that think it might be a pacific decadal oscillation a long lasting el nino like pattern in the pacific dennis hartmann a professor of atmospheric science at the university of washington doesn t believe the answer is clear i don t think we know he said in the university s news release maybe it will go away quickly and we won t talk about it anymore but if it persists for a third year then we ll know something really unusual is going on cnn s sam stringer contributed to

i don t always talk about news events with my daughters but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up one of the main things i preach to my girls ages and is the importance of respecting other people no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish it s something that my husband and i just do we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the president of the united states let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time whether it s been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant in those cases when i feel like i m going to pop i keep saying this is unacceptable this is unacceptable and either hang up in disgust or storm off not perfect ways of handling these incidents but at no time would i ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations some of mchenry s comments such as how she s on television imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she by dint of her career education and income is better than people who don t get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities mchenry showed that she either forgot those golden rule lessons from childhood or that she hasn t really lived her life with that mantra mchenry has since apologized on twitter saying she said some insulting and regrettable things and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia she should always choose to be respectful and take the high road but it s not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker i see this britt mchenry video and think it s not just about how a celebrity shouldn t act in public it s how all of us shouldn t act wrote cait on twitter said shannon also on twittter i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but now i know she s the kind of woman i hope i ve taught my daughters not to be her language and disdain brings shame on her her profession and her employer people don t all of sudden have such a vile tirade this comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors let s let her be an example to others wrote c cooper on a change org petition asking mchenry s employers to fire her the mchenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her this morning i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn and that led to another conversation my kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to treat other people the way you would want them to treat you even in uncomfortable moments celebrity apologies the good bad and uncomfortable so britt mchenry check out these examples of how the rich famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity after british journalist katie hopkins seriously fat shamed pop music star kelly clarkson saying a host of insulting things about the singer s weight clarkson won praise for her graceful response that s because she doesn t know me i m awesome it doesn t bother me it s a free world say what you will i ve just never cared what people think she said a college baseball player gets suspended for calling little league baseball phenom mo ne davis a slut her response she emailed bloomsburg university asking that the college reinstate him everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance davis the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in little league world series history told espn i know right now he s really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is i mean i was pretty hurt on my part but i know he s hurting even more when an argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to pope francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country s president ahead of the general election in october and possibly influencing the outcome what did the pope do well he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation the pope appears to have been more than graceful because after the conversation the journalist pledged to learn how to pray when queen bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip synching the national anthem in honor of president obama s inauguration in she didn t come out swinging instead she admitted to singing along with her pre recorded track at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring a cappella rendition of the national anthem finally reese witherspoon may be the closest example for mchenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode when witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in for suspicion of driving under the influence the academy award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as do you know who i am and you re about to find out who i am she ultimately issued an apologetic statement and then went on morning television to apologize some more we went out to dinner in atlanta and we had one too many glasses of wine and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not she said on good morning america it s completely unacceptable and we are so sorry and embarrassed we know better and we shouldn t have done that and she added when a police officer tells you to stay in the car you stay in the car i learned that for sure she told the gma host now did mchenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry you never berate them for their weight job appearance and income let s hope so can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook
the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire which began years ago friday is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the th century even though the word genocide did not exist at the time the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional both for armenians who are descended from those killed and for turks the heirs to the ottomans for both groups the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts some armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged some turks still view the armenians as having been a threat to the ottoman empire in a time of war and say many people of various ethnicities including turks were killed in the chaos of war in addition some turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations so what do we know about happened in those fateful days here are some answers the ottoman turks having recently entered world war i on the side of germany and the austro hungarian empire were worried that armenians living in the ottoman empire would offer wartime assistance to russia russia had long coveted control of constantinople now istanbul which controlled access to the black sea and therefore access to russia s only year round seaports many historians agree that the number was about million however victims of the mass killings also included some of the million armenians living in the caucasus under russian rule some of whom were massacred by ottoman forces in as they marched through east armenia and azerbaijan by ottoman authorities were already portraying armenians as a threat to the empire s security then on the night of april the authorities in constantinople the empire s capital rounded up about armenian intellectuals and community leaders many of them ended up deported or assassinated april known as red sunday is commemorated as genocide remembrance day by armenians around the world friday is the th anniversary of that day this is a major point of contention estimates range from to million deaths between and with not all of the victims in the ottoman empire but most estimates including one of between and made by ottoman authorities themselves fall between and million whether due to killings or forced deportation the number of armenians living in turkey fell from million in to under by almost any way one can imagine while the death toll is in dispute photographs from the era document some mass killings some show ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning torture gas poison disease and starvation children were reported to have been loaded into boats taken out to sea and thrown overboard rape too was frequently reported in addition according to the website armenian genocide org the great bulk of the armenian population was forcibly removed from armenia and anatolia to syria where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger no genocide was not even a word at the time much less a legally defined crime the word genocide was invented in by a polish lawyer named raphael lemkin to describe the nazis systematic attempt to eradicate jews from europe he formed the word by combining the greek word for race with the latin word for killing genocide became a crime in when the united nations approved the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide the definition included acts meant to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group armenia the vatican the european parliament france russia and canada germany is expected to join that group on friday the th anniversary of the start of the killings turkey the united states the european commission the united kingdom and the united nations a u n subcommittee called the killings genocide in but current u n secretary general ban ki moon declines to use the word also a year ago on the eve of the th anniversary of red sunday then turkish prime minister now president recep tayyip erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings which he said had inhumane consequences while turkey vehemently continues to reject the word genocide his remarks went further than those of any previous turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of armenians
on the stage of a tv studio in phnom penh cambodian american ly sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic but familiar story on april years ago today life as ly knew it was shattered when her hometown the cambodian capital of phnom penh fell to the genocidal khmer rouge regime of the communist party of kampuchea ly then was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who along with virtually the entire population of phnom penh about two million people were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work ly never saw them again nor learned what happened to them but about people died from execution starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint according to war crimes prosecutors the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination where many met similar fates the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the khmer rouge s revolutionary program of social engineering intended to establish a new order free of money family ties religion education property and foreign influence aimed at creating an agrarian utopia it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era resulting in the deaths of at least million cambodians about a quarter of the country s population over the next four years ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years before her father was shot to death before her eyes in his killing prompted ly to leave her sole remaining family member youngest sister bo in the care of a local couple she set out on her own making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the united states for more than years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister i think she was the only family member to survive she says with tears in her eyes as she finishes her story the producers usher a woman on the stage it s bo ly embraces her sister and both women sob i missed you so much ly says i ve always searched for you bo tells her since production began five years ago the television show it s not a dream has reunited members of cambodian families shattered by the genocide more than have sought its help the series is just one example of the ways in which cambodia s traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught painful business of reckoning with their history the scars of the khmer rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern cambodia said theary seng a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime and who moved to the u s as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult she described the country as a land of orphans for decades after the khmer rouge were driven from phnom penh by soviet backed vietnamese forces in january the regime s crimes were seldom spoken about let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims in large part this was because people remained scared say experts far from being snuffed out by the vietnamese invasion the khmer rouge existed for another two decades after fleeing the capital in khmer rouge leader pol pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government in exile that until was recognized by the u n as the country s only legitimate representative in many villages people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades said krisna uk executive director of the center for khmer studies craig etcheson a cambodia expert at the school for conflict analysis and resolution at george mason university said that for many years there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the khmer rouge as if the very words were a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room the silence was also due to the fact that cambodians in seng s words lacked the vocabulary of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society the khmer rouge s attempts to reboot society at year zero had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country s educated classes doctors lawyers accountants engineers merchants and clergy nearly two generations of young cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill said etcheson when it was finally time to rebuild there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again even today said uk young cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school in an impoverished country one of asia s poorest albeit with predicted economic growth this year most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back she said some were even skeptical that the khmer rouge s crimes the systematic butchery of the killing fields had really occurred she added the space for discussing redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the khmer rouge tribunal said seng founded in the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia eccc is a hybrid tribunal using both cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the khmer rouge s crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice intended as a southeast asian equivalent of the nuremberg trials the tribunal which has cost million so far initially enjoyed broad support we had great hope for this process said seng the presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the khmer rouge crimes but the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals two of whom have died while facing trial another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial the khmer rouge s top leader pol pot died in having never faced charges this coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the cambodian government has soured attitudes towards the court seng who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings today regards it as a sham for many victims it is too little too late opinion an ongoing struggle for justice after the khmer rouge in the first case heard kaing guek eav also known as comrade duch commandant of the notorious tuol sleng prison where more than people were killed received a life sentence for war crimes crimes against humanity murder and torture the court s only other verdicts delivered in august last year sentenced non chea the regime s brother number two and khieu samphan brother number four to life both men have appealed their convictions in a separate case the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide evidence is expected to continue being heard into eccc spokesman lars olsen said two further and highly controversial cases known as and are also currently under investigation three people were charged last month in relation to those cases former khmer rouge navy commander meas muth im chaem a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp and ao an a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers two other suspects are being investigated olsen said no further cases would be pursued after and prime minister hun sen cambodia s strongman leader for decades has long been a vocal opponent of and claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war hun sen himself is a former khmer rouge battalion commander who defected to the vietnamese side his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal others are more forgiving of the tribunal s shortcomings etcheson a former investigator for the tribunal has described it as an imperfect vessel for delivering justice but says cambodia s leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives delivering justice for victims and completing the reintegration of former khmer rouge into society he said the most important aspects of the tribunal s work are those that take place outside the courtroom triggering changes in cambodian society in that respect the proceedings may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped he added undoubtedly cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece krisna uk said the country has seen a wave of khmer rouge memoirs written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die there s a lot of people who want to tell the world they ve been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad she said khieu samphan brother number four published one such effort ahead of his trial while sikoeun suong a sorbonne educated former diplomat for the khmer rouge regime published his journey of a khmer rouge intellectual in french in he told an interviewer from france s le monde last year that he believed that khmer rouge dictator pol pot s prescriptions for cambodia were sound i remain convinced that the marxist analysis made by pol pot of the socioeconomic situation of cambodia a poor and sparsely populated country was correct he said for survivors these self serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take but for a few of them at least cambodia s opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing however bittersweet on the stage of the it s not a dream studio as ly hugs her long lost sister footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen do you know the person in the video the show s host asks yes ly says she is my mother moments later te souymoy is brought up on stage where have you two been te asks i always worried about you two i thought you died ly says the three women

new york cnn wall street is more than ready for hillary clinton the former secretary of state confirmed on sunday what the political world has expected for months eight years after her first failed white house bid clinton will once again seek the democratic party s nomination for president i m hitting the road to earn your vote because it s your time clinton said in a video released sunday afternoon officially kicking off her campaign and i hope you ll join me on this journey as clinton sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country wall street elites are ready to roll out the red carpet but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for clinton s newly launched campaign it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector clinton has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry as a new york senator for almost a decade she represented wall street and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign and there is a certain degree of nostalgia within the industry for her husband s two term presidency marked by the s bull market and broad financial deregulation including the repeal of the glass steagall act which separated commercial banking from riskier investing activities now clinton s allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in new york and beyond many on wall street and in the broader business community view her as a dependable business friendly force within a democratic party that has grown increasingly populist during president barack obama s time in office robert wolf the former ceo of ubs americas and a close obama associate who will back clinton in said there s an incredible amount of enthusiasm for her campaign to get off the ground we know the secretary from the years of being first lady to the senator to the secretary so we have decades of working relationship with her wolf who now runs a boutique consulting firm headquartered in manhattan told cnn i don t think it s surprising that the former senator of new york is close to the finance community longtime clinton friend and prominent democratic fundraiser alan patricof who founded the venture capital firm greycroft partners said clinton has an enormous following both inside and outside of the finance world there are a lot of people who perhaps didn t know her as well before who are all set to jump on the bandwagon patricof said as compared with he added there is no diminishment just the opposite an acceleration of interest in her running for the presidency but the fanfare won t sit well with everyone the former first lady s perceived coziness with wall street is a source of irritation for liberal activists who hope to push the eventual democratic nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the primaries clinton who lost her first presidential campaign to a challenger from the left seems to recognize that the liberal wing of the party has grown even more vocal and influential since then especially on economic matters her video message on sunday centered on the theme of upward mobility and an economic recovery that has left some behind americans have fought their way back from tough economic times but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top clinton said vowing to be a champion of everyday americans that statement tracks closely with her tone in recent public appearances where the former secretary has been hitting on populist economic themes she has taken on a range of issues that most appeal to liberals such as the wealth gap minimum wage and equal pay in the months leading up to her announcement in january she took to social media to defend the dodd frank wall street reform law which contains provisions that the industry has tried to roll back attacking financial reform is risky and wrong she wrote on twitter bill daley a longtime clinton ally and former obama chief of staff said clinton has to reintroduce herself to the party if she defends policies viewed as having contributed to the financial crisis daley said that s a problem he continued my guess is she ll have enough policy positions that says she s not in the tank with them clinton s early gestures have not satisfied some activists who point to massachusetts democratic sen elizabeth warren as their candidate of choice several liberal groups have even launched a formal draft campaign to elevate the senator and highlight her progressive views former republican new hampshire sen judd gregg who served as head of the securities industry and financial markets association said part of clinton s challenge stems from the fact that the center of the democratic party has moved very much to the left hillary has always been much more rational on these issues and much more mainstream gregg said i presume she s going to get the nomination but she may be contested from the left while warren has shown no interest in running for president this cycle other democrats have been taking aim at big banks as they tour the early presidential states former maryland gov martin o malley former virginia sen jim webb and vermont sen bernie sanders an independent who caucuses with democrats are all testing the waters they have made economic populism central to their potential campaigns proposing to crack down on the banking sector reform the culture on wall street and toughen financial regulations none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with clinton s extensive fundraising apparatus but their presence in the race could exert pressure on clinton to embrace progressive policies after clinton s announcement sunday a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides we look forward to hillary clinton and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen warren has spent her life leading said ready for warren campaign manager erica sagrans in the coming days ready for warren will be stepping up our efforts to convince warren to run for president now that she is a formally declared candidate political strategists expect clinton to be more outspoken laying out her economic priorities quickly and in her own terms democratic strategist chris lehane downplayed the notion of clinton warren tension in the democratic party predicting that with clinton as an announced candidate she ll offer a pretty compelling rationale for her campaign lehane who worked in bill clinton s administration said he envisioned an economic message for clinton anchored in her biography i grew up in the midwest in a middle class family i understand the challenges that they face we need to make sure that america gives people a fair shot despite clinton s embrace of more populist rhetoric finance and business leaders aren t too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them they expect that she will be able to articulate a broad economic goals aimed at the middle class rather than one that rails against bailouts and financial excess particularly as the country gets more distance from the last financial crisis kathy wylde president of the partnership for new york city a prominent business coalition predicted that clinton would be able to maintain her relationship with wall street without alienating the liberal base the fact that clinton is knowledgeable and maintains good open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she s in anybody s pocket wylde said she s

boston cnn when the bomb went off steve woolfenden thought he was still standing that was because as he lay on the ground he was still holding the handles of his son s stroller he pulled back the stroller s cover and saw that his son leo was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head woolfenden checked leo for other injuries and thought let s get out of here that was before he noticed his achilles tendon which resembled transparent tape covered in blood and his left tibia protruding from his boot the boot was next to his left stump he testified before a federal jury thursday the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the boston marathon bombing shared their stories often gruesome and heartbreaking in the sentencing phase for dzhokhar tsarnaev the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that tsarnaev was cold hearted and remorseless the defense led by famed death penalty opponent judy clarke is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain tsarnaev s difficult upbringing clarke will begin those efforts monday a group of tsarnaev s relatives arrived at boston s logan international airport on thursday cnn affiliate whdh reported but it s not clear if they plan to testify the jury must decide whether the year old who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now deceased brother will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison woolfenden a biomedical researcher for the novartis institutes recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort leo the boy cried mommy daddy mommy daddy mommy daddy mommy daddy he testified amid the stench of burning hair blood sulfur a good samaritan emerged he gave woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed leo to safety i was completely terrified because i didn t know if i was ever going to see my son again there was blood all over the sidewalk all around me he said dr david king a trauma surgeon at massachusetts general hospital spent years in the u s army as a combat surgeon and served in iraq and afghanistan as well as in haiti after the devastating earthquake he has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices he testified and what he saw in boston that day wasn t much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones i arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up he said i looked across the patients and i knew immediately without anyone having to tell me exactly what the wounding mechanism was heather abbott had no such experience so when one of the two bombs exploded sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a puddle of chaos and blood and glass her instinct was to run but she couldn t her foot felt like it was on fire she testified two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a hail mary she called for her husband he picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant i saw blood pouring out of my foot she said she finally got to a hospital and after three attempts to save her foot which was missing its entire heel a doctor told her she had a decision she could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee she chose the latter it was probably the hardest decision i ve had to make she testified another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the tsarnaev brothers attack marc fucarile recounted the two bombs going off i stepped back and the next thing i remember was looking up at the sky he testified adding that he remembered a lot of yelling a lot of screaming people crying out for tourniquets a nurse was sitting on his chest and someone said oh s he s on fire he tried to undo his belt and got a third degree burn because the buckle was so hot a firefighter would later tell fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter he doesn t remember that in addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit he still gets blisters so where the prosthetic attaches on your butt it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds he said and though his left leg survived it was severely burned his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered he said he hopes to save the left leg he testified but it s likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee he takes more than pills pills in morning in afternoon at night to cope with his injuries he said one of the most dramatic points in thursday s testimony involved the death of young martin richard the prosecution showed close up video of the year old who was only feet from one of the bombs according to the fbi s re creation of the crime scene his parents bill and denise are opposed to tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase though bill richard did testify during the guilt phase dr king told the court that martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso it s highly unlikely the boy died instantly king said explaining that martin died of rapid blood loss king testified receptors are generally not responsive to cutting if you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver it generally does not hurt what hurts is the stretching and twisting intestines were pulled and twisted that would have caused visceral type pain woolfenden the biomedical researcher recalled seeing martin and his mother shortly after the good samaritan took woolfenden s son leo to safety i saw martin s face and i could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured he said martin s hair was singed his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape as for martin s torso i saw an immense amount of blood i was really really terrified woolfenden said he recalled denise richard pleading with her son saying please and martin over and over woolfenden placed his hand on denise richard s back he said she turned to ask woolfenden if he was ok he said he was and she turned her attention back to martin but no response came according to testimony martin s aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast he bled to death on the sidewalk and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs cnn s patrick cornell contributed to this report
it s only a few weeks since the first presidential announcement but already it feels like the campaign is in high gear a number of politicians have officially announced their candidacies and the outline of their messages is starting to emerge hillary clinton who announced last week even jumped into her black van for a road trip out to iowa including a pit stop at chipotle along the way although the campaign has barely begun most of the candidates and some probable candidates are already starting to make mistakes most of the mistakes will simply be blips along the way but some of them might end up being more damaging if they feed into negative perceptions that voters have about the candidates here are a few notable mistakes in the past few weeks trying to separate himself from the pack new jersey gov chris christie called for substantial cuts to social security he also promised to reverse the marijuana legalization laws that many states have been enacting in response to ballot initiatives both of these statements could come back to bite him should he run for president while christie sees social security cuts as a way to go big in crafting a platform for a possible presidential run as many republicans have discovered social security is a very popular program and one that has strong support from americans who are over a big part of the electorate on marijuana legalization christie inserted himself into an issue that has growing public support in red and blue states especially with the younger and independent voters who christie is promising to bring into a potential campaign if christie continues to veer right it will be harder to sell himself as the moderate in the race and yet there is little chance that he will secure conservative votes over someone like sen ted cruz sen cruz impressed many observers when he announced his candidacy at liberty university but soon after he did something that took many people by surprise the texas senator who has been one of the leading opponents of president barack obama s health care plan acknowledged that he would be enrolling in the affordable care act program since his wife was taking a leave of absence from her job to help with the campaign it will be hard for him to live this one down since he wants to sell himself as the authentic conservative and the republican who will give democrats their biggest toughest fight the fact that he decided to join a program he has railed against and tied up congress with will raise questions about whether he is just another politician and not a true zealot over obamacare the decision will offer plenty of fodder to democrats who want to remind voters that republicans rail against government even when they and their constituents depend on it if anyone faces authenticity questions it is kentucky sen rand paul as the so called libertarian in the campaign paul is aiming to attract younger republicans who otherwise are not interested in the party he is also hoping to bring back hard core anti government conservatives who believed that their party has moved too far away from their original goals paul has already struggled to justify some of his recent announcements such as calling for a more aggressive war against isis and his statements against gay marriage but after announcing his presidency he brought himself more trouble with his aggressive interaction with today host savannah guthrie paul became clearly aggravated with what the host and went so far as go explain how to conduct the interview the interview focused most media attention on paul s temper and his interactions with women rather than his message in an interview on cnbc he put his finger to his lips and said shhh calm down to anchor kelly evans both moments revealed a side of his character than until that moment had been somewhat off the radar you re coming off as pretty thin skinned in your interviews megyn kelly of fox news told the senator thus far clinton has had a fairly smooth opening but during her first week on the trail she did make a minor mistake while speaking in norwalk iowa clinton said during a discussion about immigration reform that all my grandparents you know came over here even though only one was really an immigrant her staff corrected the statements her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants as has been correctly pointed out while her grandfather was an immigrant it appears that hillary s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the u s in the early s clinton s campaign video seemed pitch perfect to many observers as she largely removed herself from the story line her drive to iowa demonstrated that she isn t likely to repeat the kinds of mistakes that she made in when she failed to take the nuts and bolts of caucus organization seriously although the entire opening certainly had the flavor of a made for television event it has generally been well received clearly the biggest gaffe in the run up to the clinton campaign was in how she handled the story of her use of a private server rather than the state department email system although she dragged out the campaign announcement she certainly should have had more of the team in place given how much attention she would receive at first she stumbled in her response giving the accusers time to spin the story as reflecting a tendency to hide information and suggesting that she was still the untruthful person so many people suspected rubio announced his presidential run after the biggest announcement of them all hillary clinton given that rubio is not one of the most well known of the candidates outside of republican political circles his timing was not perfect the announcement was overshadowed by clinton s video and drive to iowa coming on the heels of obama s historic discussions with cuba the timing and sequence didn t help the senator to get the kind of initial buzz that he was hoping for although in the long run this won t make a difference it might have been wise for him to delay the announcement and give his campaign some breathing space all of these are still relatively small missteps in the very start of the campaign and we know from social scientists than individual gaffes and mistakes don t really have a big impact on the outcome of these contests so much as the fundamentals like the ability to raise campaign contributions and the endorsements from political elites still mistakes can play a role in campaigns while individual mistakes might be fleeting collectively these kinds of moments can shape how voters think of candidates when the time comes for a vote

the world s seventh largest economy is heading toward collapse an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at trillion one that annually churns out the equivalent of trillion is under assault however i am not referring to one of the g economies but to the super economy of the ocean it s one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted and it is going downhill fast the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday reviving the ocean economy the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland true the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations the fact is that the ocean feeds us employs us offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity such as climate regulation and oxygen production that are difficult to put in monetary terms and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling seventy percent of the ocean s overall economic value relies on its continued health ocean assets like fisheries coral reefs mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world s top economies will lose their value if we continue to over exploit and outright destroy them that may seem like a far off possibility to some but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report for example percent of the world s fish stocks are either fully exploited or over exploited and that is not all by only a few decades from now it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs which have already been halved in the last few decades this isn t just a concern for dive enthusiasts but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks the ocean is truly too big to fail the loss of the ocean s critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage fortunately our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy three of which are critical this year first the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment including the ocean and human well being also negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change and finally leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next years the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers all this said and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean s health has been its fastest in millions of years there is actually some potential good news if we act swiftly and with determination marine resources can recover and recover quickly many local examples from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel from the fiji archipelago to the arctic show us that conservation restoration and sustainable use approaches mean the ocean and the people who depend on it can both prosper ultimately the ocean bridges continents connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate after all it s far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces

they come from more than countries drawn to libya as the funnel to europe eritreans want to escape repression or military service somalis flee al shabaab and clan warfare syrians have given up hope of returning home in villages in senegal and elsewhere across west africa young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in europe perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved according to researchers and human rights groups but in more than of them headed for the libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation from the horn of africa to the atlantic from syria and gaza these would be migrants travel well established smuggling routes along the way they must cross deserts and mountains risk kidnap or robbery are often cheated or left stranded one african migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days a teenage somali who made it to malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come i tell them its sure that you will die he said the international organization for migration iom has tracked the migrant flows through north africa for years eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers escaping an authoritarian government poverty and indefinite military service a land without possibilities many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention torture or punishment of their families according to a report by the regional mixed migration secretariat rmms in nairobi last year they travel to sudan so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay one eritrean woman told the un refugee agency unhcr this month that she had paid to reach the mediterranean eritreans and syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to europe last year according to arezo malakooti director of migration research at altai consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns malakooti has recently visited seven countries including libya tunisia and morocco to update her study the push factor is much greater than the pull of europe she says upheavals and instability across much of africa and the middle east combined with the perception that libya s doors are open have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach libya worsening repression in eritrea has been one factor she says while eritreans already in refugee camps in sudan have decided to make a dash for the mediterranean one reason is that other routes through saudi arabia and to israel have become more difficult israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would be eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the sinai desert including detention and yemen s implosion has cut off that conduit as one eritrean told the humanitarian journal irin last year people were traveling to israel because it was the only way and now they re traveling to europe because it s the only way somalis often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the mediterranean face a perfect storm of crises extreme poverty prolonged insecurity sexual violence and other serious human rights violations lack of access to basic needs such as food medical services healthcare and livelihoods are all contributory factors says the rmms sea tossed storm of human misery hits italian shores the iom told cnn it is seeing a spike in would be migrants from senegal mali guinea and gambia in west africa many reason that libya s chaos is an opportunity border posts are left abandoned the coastline unguarded most west africans make the journey for economic reasons the majority are single men in their twenties populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking often say researchers the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home perhaps misled by fables of riches malakooti noted in a recent report that unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed but west africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home senegalese were recently repatriated from libya by the red cross and iom malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before french led intervention pushed them back joel millman of the iom says there s also been an increase in the number of nigerian christians following this route escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by boko haram another disturbing phenomenon according to malakooti is the trafficking of african women for prostitution to italy through libya while still a small fraction of the overall migration the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in europe rose threefold in she says why migrants are risking their lives to reach italy a geneva based group the global initiative against transnational organized crime estimated last year that about half of west african migrants pass through the town of agadez in northern niger a crackdown in on organized convoys leaving agadez stemmed the flow for a while but gangs from the toubou tribe which controls the cross border trade developed new routes and raised their prices a migrant might pay as much as to reach southern libya in a truck or pick up according to researchers reliable figures on the numbers passing through agadez are difficult to come by but the consensus among experts is somewhere between and every month other hubs include khartoum in sudan a way station for migrants from east africa and tamanrasset in southern algeria where a fake malian passport aids passage algeria has also been a destination for syrian refugees but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes often through turkey and the greek islands hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in libya for years attracted to jobs as day laborers when moammar gadhafi was in power now they face violence discrimination and religious persecution and are unable even to remit home what little they earn so at least some are embarking on a journey to europe they never intended to take malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach europe the recent murder of egyptian and ethiopian christians by isis s libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some a similar dynamic applies to syrian refugees initially they remained in lebanon jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict says malakooti now they ve given up or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated and have decided to try to reach europe and start over within libya the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks according to human rights organizations they cluster in dusty towns such as sabha and qatrun and use what are known as connection houses how is europe going to tackle migrant crisis those driving migrants to tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast such a journey across the desert to avoid checkpoints might cost a migrant in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries tribal feuds roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler the arrival of the islamic state in iraq and syria isis in libya has further complicated passage in january jihadists killed libyan soldiers near sabha malakooti detects a changing pattern since the syrian conflict began it has injected more money into the smuggling business which has therefore become more organized the more reliable groups can charge more she says some migrants buy a package from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel syrian migrants are relatively better off than west africans and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks or consigned to an inflatable dinghy fearing arrest the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves instead giving a compass or gps device to the migrants who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port as libya becomes more dangerous for migrants other countries on both sides of the mediterranean are looking on anxiously some west africans opt to travel through morocco even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to spain very difficult a migrant might need or attempts before making it to the spanish coast says malakooti tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with libya both algeria and morocco have begun building fences along their border against both terrorism and clandestine migration but they may be little deterrent the eritrean writer abu bakr khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the mediterranean himself in his novel african titanics he describes the dangerous lure of escape only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea if god loved me he would not have brought me here groaned one of the passengers assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life he threw himself into the sea the boat moved forward at the whim of the waves meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants
seoul south korea cnn on march a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in south korea then more ominously on december last year computers at the country s nuclear operator were breached again cybercrime was suspected the source of these attacks north korea and south korean investigators say they have proof the actual malicious codes used in the attacks they shared this data with cnn the attack known as dark seoul paralyzed an estimated computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean it would try to delete essentially all your files then restart the system you would come back up and nothing would be there joshua james a digital forensic expert told cnn if it infected more financial systems it could have deleted all financial data in korea i mean it is dangerous the visiting professor at chuncheon s hallym university added live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals or transfer money online dark seoul happened shortly after the north korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three year korean war to an end in july amid growing tensions with its neighbor the latest high profile digital incursion in december attempted to steal data from south korea s nuclear operator including plant blueprints and personnel information though investigators said no critical data was stolen the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the nuclear power plants it runs the attack itself was described by james as a spear fishing exercise where unsuspecting victims retired and current employees of the nuclear operator were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email as soon as you double click on it it starts running in the background of your computer where you can t see it s also trying to open up your computer what we call a back door to give access to the infected system by the attacker he told cnn the attack which james said was simpler than dark seoul came just a few days after sony pictures said their systems has been hacked another attack the south korean authorities blamed on north korea from a law enforcement or investigation side we re trying to actually trace back to who did it said james seoul announced in mid march that some of the ip addresses used in december incursion could be traced back to shenyang china which can be easily accessed from the north korean border codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the north koreans south korean authorities said the malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as kimsuky codes known to be used by north korea the prosecutor s office that leads other government agencies and internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in march pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks calling them a plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth but many experts say north korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival indeed south korea s defense ministry estimates that north korea is operating a cyberarmy of workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability hacks are going on all the time constantly though how many actually make the news is a very small amount said james how many are detected in general i think the average person would have no clue they ve been hacked organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they re not he added many in south korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks a report by the korea institute for industrial economics and trade a government funded think tank estimates that dark seoul caused about million worth of damage its report published in predicted that by south korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to billion in economic damage
the united states is failing its partners if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat and we re not doing nearly enough to address the problem the trouble is that little of our foreign military financing including the recent counterterrorism partnership funds goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism as a result violent extremists are making troubling gains it s not because we don t recognize the problem nor that we don t talk the talk the national security strategy speaks to the importance of american led partnerships while the quadrennial defense review noted that we will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity despite this apparent recognition the united states is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long term investment in special operations units in key partner nations as a result of this neglect since the attacks of september we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the middle east but also in indonesia india and sub saharan africa just look at the case of kenya on september al shabaab jihadists attacked the westgate mall in nairobi executing dozens of unarmed men women and children less than two years later at garissa university al shabaab jihadists attacked university dormitories butchering almost people the perpetrators were separating the christians from the muslims and systemically executing the christians before detonating their suicide vests during both incidents the kenyan forces response was horribly executed sadly kenya is not the exception and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital u s assistance in u s taxpayers are providing billion in foreign military finance the majority of which is going to israel and egypt kenya meanwhile was slated to receive a mere million nigeria which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of boko haram has been afforded only simply put the united states is spreading foreign military assistance too thin while also failing to make necessary long term commitments it takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities but although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy u s security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners the reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare we are also failing to develop long term programs of record bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with plan colombia this program as well as the recent u s mission to support our filipino partners against abu sayyaf demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by u s special forces when coupled with long term funding and true interagency cooperation true the section global train and equip program fulfills some needs but money from the program only provides limited support it is an annual appropriation for new and emerging counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the u s armed forces are a participant another program that builds special operations capacity the joint combined exchange and training program is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train u s forces first and foremost not our partners with all this in mind it is clearly time for congress to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards by investing everywhere we are investing nowhere which is why we need to make choices about where the united states and its allies will see maximum benefit the united states has a choice reinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time but to get this right congress needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats this will mean asking the departments of state and defense to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete at the same time congress needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that state and defense planners can do their job too attacks such as mumbai and westgate are easy to plan do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the world we can expect to see a lot more of these but with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement we can start to make progress it goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism the causes of which are complex and diverse but having credible special operations forces is a great first step and for many of our partner nations the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home

geography is in part destiny for italy the country will always be a bridge between africa and europe as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the mediterranean so starkly shows a surge of refugees this year usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels has sought to reach europe via the libyan coast a boatload of migrants who embarked from libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking over were rescued off the coast of italy in the last week alone european leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency there is a backstory here worthy of our attention and it has to do with italy s colonial past many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of italy s former colonies in north and east africa namely eritrea occupied from and somalia as migrants libyans are fewer in number but libya plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for italy italy s empire never rivaled that of the british and the french in scope and longevity but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected indeed the migrants traversing the mediterranean today form part of a century long chain of migrations expulsions and exiles sparked by italy s imperial ambition and commercial interests the post colonial anger of african leaders and now mass economic desperation and political strife long after the formal end of italian colonialism these eritreans somalis and libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries it also affects the treatment of africans who settle in italy libya is an example of the long reach of italian imperialism libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of italy on the model of french algeria and libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship s persecution of those who resisted italian occupation over libyan men women and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late s and early s and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed col moammar gadhafi who ruled from to was born during the italian occupation of his country and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as omar al mukhtar who was hanged by the fascists in front of of his people in in soon after he took power gadhafi struck back expelling the remaining italian community in libya some of those people had grown up entirely in libya they arrived in italy for the first time at some of the same ports receiving migrants today this political intervention did not spell the end of italian libyan commercial dealings which grew out of colonial era relations that had made libya italy s biggest oil supplier since italy and libya have been directly connected by the greenstream natural gas pipeline which runs below the mediterranean on the same axis as many migrant boats commercial concerns and the cozy relationship of then prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi also lay behind a historic friendship treaty between italy and libya which promised infrastructure and other aid to libya worth the equivalent of billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by italy during the decades of colonial rule until his death in despite deals with italy and the european union to control departures from his borders gadhafi intermittently used european fears of mass arrivals of migrants from libya as a political weapon given europe s geography this weapon was pointed particularly at italy libya s former master and the principal target of gadhafi s post colonial revenge politics few italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise upon her appointment in as minister of integration cécile kyenge an italian of congolese origin faced ugly racist attacks from fellow italian politicians including a comment that she looked like an orangutan this climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the heroes of fascist imperialism in the town of affile built a publicly funded memorial to general rodolfo graziani known as the butcher of fezzan for his brutal repression of libyan resisters in the s and for the massacre of ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a attempt on his life this colonial history and its long term consequences can help us understand italians ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly and yet migrants who remain in italy are often subject to racist attacks it is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the italian navy in was the slogan of the fascist s dictatorship s bid to control the mediterranean mare nostrum the program rescued more than migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to european union budget restrictions it seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the italian government to its past aggressions an admirable and courageous initiative advanced under an imperialist banner the italian government deserves the full support of the european union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis but it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past at years old italian prime minister matteo renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the mediterranean setting a new course on this issue is in italy s interest now more than ever

vidarbha india cnn yogita kanhaiya is expecting a baby soon she already has a two year old son her husband moreshwor a cotton farmer won t be around to see his children grown up he committed suicide early in the pregnancy eight years back yogita s father in law also a cotton farmer took his own life he was in so much debt year old yogita said of her late husband he wasn t getting any money from cotton he chose death over distress it s a familiar story in families across western india s cotton production belt where a cotton lobbyist group claims one cotton farmer commits suicide every eight hours we get reports of two to three farmer suicides every day said kishor tiwari leader of the farmers advocacy group vidarbha jan andolan samiti vjas vidarbha in the eastern region of the state of maharashtra is known as the epicenter of the suicide crisis according to vjas data some farmers from the area have taken their lives since more than have died since the start of this year there are a number of reasons for the hopelessness among vidarbha farmers unseasonal rain and hail destroyed many crops earlier this year but they ve also had to contend with the flipside a plentiful harvest in drove prices down while production costs rose leaving many farmers either lacking income or burdened with debt from loans taken out to help keep them afloat last year was a record year for cotton production resulting in a glut of cotton on the world market india produced million bales of the fiber in crop year and is the second largest global cotton grower after china the record surplus of cotton in the global market pushed down prices hurting farmers particularly in vidarbha which is becoming increasingly reliant on cotton our land mostly supports only two crops cotton and soybean but for the past few years soybean yield has consistently been decreasing so we mostly depend on cotton said murali dhidkar a local cotton farmer he said in the past year cotton prices had halved i m getting around dollars per quintal just a year ago it was dollars i ve never seen such a low price the costs of pesticides fertilizers and seeds are increasing but the cotton price is falling down he points out the dismal condition of debt ridden farmers like himself in vidarbha many of whom are forced to take out loans or give up farming government officials do not come to the village and listen to our plight just a few days ago my neighbor burnt himself alive dhidkar said tiwari from the farmers advocacy group said many farmers in vidarbha had lost hope that the situation would improve it is an epidemic how many more farmers need to commit suicide before the government steps in to find a solution to this problem more than of india s population is involved in the agricultural and allied sector which contributes of the country s gdp government data shows farmers committed suicide in across india that is deaths every day earlier this month prime minister narendra modi raised the amount of compensation paid for damaged crops and lowered the threshold for farmers to claim payouts however that failed to appease farmers who are angry about the government s land acquisition bill which critics say makes it easier for the government to seize farmers land modi s ruling bjp party said the old rules were unnecessarily restrictive and the new bill is needed to spur investment and smooth the way for growth the government is expected to reintroduce the new land bill when parliament reopens this week on sunday thousands of farmers gathered in delhi at a rally led by opposition congress party to protest against the bill waving flags they blasted modi government s policies as pro industrialist and anti farmer tiwari of the farmer s advocacy group said the government needs to do more to stop the wave of suicides across the country he said modi s push to open bank accounts for every indian household neglected to address the major concern in farming households of falling incomes prime minister modi boasts about india rising but he is not willing to talk about india dying tiwari said he says for a start the government should guarantee a better market price for cotton and waive farmers overdue debt divisional commissioner of the vidarbha region dnyaneshwar rajurkar said the state government is aware of the situation and is planning to roll out relief programs to help local cotton farmers the plans include halving bank loan interest rates and waiving loans from private money lenders rajurkar said the government is also planning to deploy doctors to counsel farmers in distress just days away from her baby s birth kanhaiya said she worries about how she s going to feed her family i have to pay the loan back both to bank and private money lenders i have no clue how i will pay the debt once the baby is born i will look for work i will have to do labor jobs all my life to pay the loan she said despair in her voice i did receive compensation from the local state government after my husband s death but it is very minimal that does nothing to solve the grave problem i am in
a north pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded the whale named varvara swam nearly miles kilometers according to a release from oregon state university whose scientists helped conduct the whale tracking study varvara which is russian for barbara left her primary feeding ground off russia s sakhalin island to cross the pacific ocean and down the west coast of the united states to baja mexico varvara s journey surpassed a record listed on the guinness worlds records website it said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere mile round trip between the warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food rich waters of the arctic and antarctic regions records are nice but bruce mate the lead author of the study thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim during her mile journey varvara visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales which was a surprise to mate who is also the director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university for her to go to mexico mate said it s pretty strong evidence that it s where she s from varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale but her ability to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive he said in the release which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays with only western gray whales believed to be in existence that number might be even lower past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species but this suggests we may need to take a closer look mate said fourth baby orca born this season
relations between iran and saudi arabia have always been thorny but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today tehran and riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the middle east in its most recent incarnation the iranian saudi conflict by proxy has reached yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic for riyadh and its regional allies the saudi military intervention in yemen operation decisive storm is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shia iranian influence for tehran and its regional allies including the houthi movement in yemen saudi arabia s actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war when iranian president hassan rouhani was elected in june he pledged to reach out to riyadh he was up front and called tehran s steep deterioration of relations with the saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on iranian foreign policy from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistan and the gaza strip the iranian saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly and yet despite rouhani s open pledge profound differences over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels unlike in syria and in iraq the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranian backed rebels in yemen while riyadh no doubt exaggerates tehran s role in the yemen crisis its fingerprints are nonetheless evident iran provides financial support weapons training and intelligence to houthis gerald feierstein a u s state department official and former yemen ambassador told a congressional hearing last week we believe that iran sees opportunities with the houthis to expand its influence in yemen and threaten saudi and gulf arab interests the iranians find the charges biased and point to the saudi airstrikes in yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor s affairs in iran the cue came from the country s top authority supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who has been unusually blunt he tweeted despite disputes the saudis used to display composure with us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power replaced composure with barbarism three days after khamenei s speech iran suspended religious pilgrimages to mecca this came as news broke about two iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudi arabia meanwhile anti saudi protests have been staged in a number of iranian cities khamenei s speech opened the floodgate of anti saudi statements the voices of hardline figures in tehran have been the most agitated general ahmad purdastan the commander of the iranian ground forces taunted the saudis beware of the day when firecrackers explode in riyadh purdastan said in a not so subtle warning but it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the saudis ayatollah ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president and arguably iran s most vocal advocate of better iranian saudi relations called riyadh s military intervention a strategic mistake and urged for a political solution seeking a political solution is iran s stated aim for the yemeni crisis but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim iranian foreign minister javad zarif has provided a four point plan to get a ceasefire to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid to promote political dialogue among warring yemeni parties and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government but the iranian proposal also asks for an end to saudi airstrikes as zarif put it iran and saudi arabia need to talk but we cannot talk to determine the future of yemen the saudis have thus far ignored the iranian proposal meanwhile the houthi leadership has welcomed the plan as one of its leaders said in iran s plan unacceptable solutions do not exist not only do the saudis not have any faith in any iranian drafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis but riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it saudi arabia was elated by the u n security council vote on april that condemned the houthi movement only russia abstained but a solution to the yemeni crisis will not come from the u n the u n can provide a cover for riyadh s military intervention but it cannot secure it a military win this leaves riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in yemen saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the houthi movement and it allies in the yemeni armed forces it requires ground troops on a huge scale riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco the pakistanis most famously turned down the saudi request and let it be known that yemen is a quagmire they can do without instead islamabad has asked iran to push the houthis for a political compromise that riyadh can live with the turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis but in his visit to tehran last week turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized iranian turkish trade relations over rivalry in yemen and emphasized a political solution for the yemeni conflict the egyptians and the jordanians are still supportive of saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist riyadh in yemen but whether they will go through with it is another matter egypt has a long list of problems of its own including a bloody counter terrorism campaign in sinai that it cannot afford to lose but also an eastern border with lawless libya that is increasingly a new front in cairo s fight against jihadists it is hard to see how egyptian general abdel fattah el sisi can commit troops to a yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to egypt s security the same kind of domestic realities including the threat from isis will also prevent jordan from any significant contribution to saudi military efforts in yemen these hard realities leave riyadh with two options it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same houthis that riyadh is attacking today alternatively given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops riyadh will have to contemplate a full scale invasion of yemen that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate the iranians too are faced with stark choices it is beyond tehran s ability to tame the yemeni crisis as tempting as it might be for tehran to see the saudis bleed in yemen the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the middle east will undermine broader regional iranian interests a political compromise that both riyadh and tehran and their respective yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic

for many girl scout troops it is officially cookie season i feel guilty saying no to the sweet enthusiastic girls standing outside my grocery store who use their smiles and newly practiced sales pitches to ask how many boxes i d like to order after all the organization is dedicated to enhancing girls character and confidence and i have to admit that the samoas now called caramel delites are delicious but as a physician who is passionate about health promotion i politely tell the girls no thanks i am concerned that every bite and every sale not only delivers an unhealthy snack but also a dangerous nutrition message and i m surprised that more doctors aren t speaking up about this thin mints the most popular cookie contains refined white flour sugar partially hydrogenated oil and high fructose corn syrup the first ingredient in those caramel delites is sugar but they also contain corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup for a total of grams of sugar per cookie that s a lot of sugar and while some experts debate whether high fructose corn syrup is any worse than sugar we agree that both in the vast quantities we americans consume contribute to obesity but i m not only concerned about obesity there are two other more insidious and dangerous risks to consider cancer and heart disease how could a cookie cause cancer let me explain both high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the united states are largely made from genetically modified crops of the sugar beets grown in the united states are gmo as is percent of the corn those crops are engineered to withstand spraying of the monsanto herbicide roundup ready last month the international agency for research on cancer declared the key ingredient glyphosate a probable carcinogen canola oil another cookie ingredient is also of concern of rape seed from which canola is produced is gmo too suddenly those cookies seem less benign don t they if that isn t enough to dampen your cravings recent studies have found a causal link between sugar and heart disease and trans fats have been well documented to increase the risk of heart disease a few years ago this was a big story and most products now boast that they have zero trans fats in reality companies are allowed to claim zero on the label if a serving contains less than grams of trans fats but often we eat more than one serving do you really stop at two cookies so rather than zero your actual intake can be several grams adding to the confusion on the ingredient label transfats show up as partially hydrogenated oils including in thin mints caramel delites peanut butter patties and other popular girl scout cookies clearly the girl scouts leadership knows of the dangers they actively advertise on the boxes and web site those cookies contain zero grams trans fat per serving you might be thinking wow i m glad dr maizes wasn t my mom but my kids will tell you i love a good dessert in fact i make a mean cheesecake an occasional home baked cookie is not going to ruin a kid s health the problem is bigger than cookies there is too little conversation on the hazards of sugar white flour gmos and trans fats from those whom you would expect to call them out physicians perhaps this is not so surprising after all pediatricians whose job is to protect the health of children have a sum total of zero hours of required nutrition education in their residencies nor do residency review committees require internists family physicians or cardiologists to learn nutrition and yet there is compelling evidence that a diet rich in vegetables and fruit whole grains fish nuts and moderate amounts of dairy and alcohol as well as avoiding smoking obesity and exercising minutes a day lowers overall mortality by similar results were found in the study published under the name healthy living is the best revenge which showed that eating a healthy diet fruits vegetables beans whole grains nuts seeds and low meat consumption would prevent of chronic disease of diabetes of heart attacks of strokes and of all cancers at the university of arizona center for integrative medicine where i serve as executive director we are seeking to remedy this we include nutrition in all our training programs and have a new hour online course that is being pilot tested at five pediatric residencies including stanford universities of arizona chicago and kansas and eastern virginia medical school we also run an annual nutrition and health conference to address nutrition education for physicians in practice educating doctors will not be enough parents and schools have a role to play as well and the girl scouts with their enormous reach and influence could do their part and choose a new fundraising item times change and our traditions evolve what if this spring the girls sold fresh fruit and vegetables tomato plants or flowers or even pedometers what if in addition to their characters and confidence we directly addressed the health of their bodies read more what girl scout cookies taught me about life
it won t come as news to anyone in america today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority initial stop and question pulling someone over for a traffic violation becomes significant because of the potential result deadly force a minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants an initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest and an arrest we know can have fatal results in south carolina earlier this month walter scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over in unpaid child support according to court records that means that once he was stopped he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion but failure to pay child support is not a crime at least not in the traditional sense though states do criminalize it it s rightly a civil matter skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court isn t about catching criminals it s bill collection only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons and acting under color of law this raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing not all warrants are created equal sometimes there are warrants for arrest which are issued for alleged murders drug dealing or sexual assault then there are cases like the scott case bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes don t get me wrong deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well being today forget the school to prison pipeline lousy parents are the prison pipeline particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads still given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement first it s important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court s intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event yes parents who can t resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts but once the courts and law enforcement are involved they do things their way and it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own south carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings oftentimes and sadly so papa is a rolling stone and he falls behind on his payments when a supporting parent has fallen behind the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order at the hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that well he would love to pay but right now he s just in the process of getting himself together and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well established language of support shirkers the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he s too poor to pay his child s support if he fails to demonstrate this inability the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments what follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon a game show and debtor s prison the defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail if he can t he ll be stuck in jail until he does pay and let s face it while it s hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to you guessed it earn money to pay that debt of course since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates mixed up the court s remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court that warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on monday the point is this some warrants are for the arrest of criminals those are the warrants we re familiar with from law order and every other cop show other warrants like those for contempt of a support order have nothing to do with crime they re bill collection and are essentially civil in nature yet we ve foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency that s right the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts when they run a driver s name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up those same police who are armed with tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills not because he s dangerous not because he s a criminal because he s breathtakingly financially irresponsible walter scott might have run because he knew the drill he knew he was going to be arrested he shouldn t have run but he also definitely shouldn t have been shot if he owed in arrears he definitely shouldn t have been looking to buy a mercedes as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do but whether or not he ran the result would have been the same if he had a bench warrant he was going to jail by force if necessary even though he does not appear to have committed a crime of course the counterargument is if we don t arrest them how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up there s no easy answer but the better question may be why do we as a society not shun parents who don t take care of their kids social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution and one that could be solved with less government intrusion and more community involvement the scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths if we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads we can t be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them while no one should be shot for failure to pay support we re also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force empowered to use deadly force to aid in collecting these bills if we are then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight and if we re comfortable with that then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase and making the arrest sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment then our only defense is to watch and record note an earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime
espn s britt mchenry this week found herself in the news rather than reporting on it after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in arlington virginia among the highlights as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to liveleak i m on television and you re in a f king trailer honey and i wouldn t work at a scumbag place like this makes my skin crawl even being here and finally lose some weight baby girl it s pretty cringe worthy stuff that seems difficult if not impossible to defend mchenry quickly issued an apology blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility it was however too late the firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on twitter where she was called everything from classist class less and ugly on the inside to a sad self hating coward espn meanwhile announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words even if that s what she was thinking least of all because in our youtube age such missteps always come to light but while mchenry s reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement evidence of a mean girl who never left high school what s also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing or it seems caring about the other side of the story the video that was released by the tow company was heavily edited and included only mchenry s responses not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on mchenry knew she was being taped at one point she looks directly at the camera the employee even threatens to make the video public did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self destructive streak or because she truly could not help herself or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game how britt mchenry could have responded these days there s nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace whether it s lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing that the over privileged and semi famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial the high price of public shaming online sure mchenry probably feels entitled but that s our doing too we re a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal celebrating them compensating them and yet when in a moment of frustration and stress mchenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away we re right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve you know what gives her the nerve we do be honest when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot but we re really no better than she is the problem with social media and our dependence on it is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want biased or not fair or not it s the power of the press without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against think about it who was worse mchenry or the people who made that video public and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation who is worse britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee s bad teeth or the twitter masses who call for justice and the return of class who express views like part of me feels bad for britt mchenry poor thing actually believes she was hired for brains and education shouldn t they question whether in fact mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself sorry to break it to you but these days we re all bullies at least britt mchenry owns up to it

prison life won t be pretty for aaron hernandez the former nfl player and convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole after correction officers evaluate him he will be shipped to massachusetts flagship maximum security prison one of the most high tech jails in the united states with no history of breakouts the souza baranowski correctional center in shirley about miles outside downtown boston it s called souza for short and it s the state s newest prison opened in with a matrix of cameras recording live hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire i don t know the date but he ll be going there that s the maximum security facility department of corrections spokesman darren duarte said legal advocates for inmates describe souza as sterile and violent at once its diverse demographic includes the young and the old many of whom are also doing life one stubborn problem is that opiates are smuggled to inmates the legal advocates said it s very shiny and clean looking and very sterile said leslie walker executive director of prisoners legal services of massachusetts who has been visiting the souza prison about every six weeks for the past years and serves indigent prisoners there but she added it is a very dangerous prison that is right now experiencing a veritable flood of opiates officials said hernandez is being processed at the maximum security massachusetts correctional institution cedar junction in walpole just a handful of miles from gillette stadium where he once played tight end for the new england patriots under a five year million contract the prison system has yet to determine where to initially place hernandez in souza solitary confinement the less harsh but restricted block the general population a privileged section known as the lifers block for those serving a life sentence or the kitchen block for those who work in the prison kitchen at this point in time we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of hernandez is complete duarte said right now he ll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door but they will figure all that out hernandez was sent immediately for processing after wednesday s sentencing and jury conviction duarte said a news outlet helicopter followed hernandez s transfer to mci cedar junction prison officials will be concerned about hernandez s safety and whether any enemies gangs or headline seeking inmates will try to hurt hernandez who will become souza s most famous resident there could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him walker said then he s going to have to be separated and it s going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him the good news is that the superintendent of souza baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being who i m sure will do everything he can to keep mr hernandez safe walker added the person at the top sets the tone he s fairly new and he s doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible that superintendent osvaldo vidal couldn t be immediately reached for comment wednesday because of his celebrity hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards said larry levine a former federal inmate who spent years in high and minimum security prisons there will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star said levine who founded wall street prison consultants which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison in the long run however it may not matter much in what section of the prison hernandez does his time about of the inmates in the maximum security prison are locked in their cells for hours a day said walker the legal advocate it s pretty grim walker said souza has slightly larger cells than most other massachusetts prisons but not by much walker said even so the cells are stark small rooms of painted cinder block walls with metal fixtures a bunk mounted to the wall a toilet and sink combination a small writing shelf attached to the wall and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor walker said there s also a shelf for a small television which must have a clear back for easy inspection walker said with the exception of the tv which inmates can buy for under all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them she said there are two windows one roughly by inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall building or trees and a tiny window on the cell door which has two slots for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door she said there s very little to do walker said of inmate life it was built as a punishment facility the thing in corrections is that you don t want people to like it there some people have been there since it opened and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both to combat opiate use among inmates prison guards use narcotics sniffing dogs for inspections walker said it s pretty pathetic i have clients in souza prison who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean walker said there also are gangs in the prison she said as for violence one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year walker said if hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement it won t be pleasant walker said solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in the lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad walker said initially prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety but i hope not walker said it s very hard time opinion the shame of aaron hernandez
if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration s clean power plan is an energy policy plan not a carbon reduction plan all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy nuclear is our largest source of carbon free energy generating over of our carbon free electricity surely president barack obama s climate plan allegedly aimed at reducing the united states overall carbon emissions would revitalize the nuclear industry lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets well think again james hansen the former head of nasa s goddard institute for space studies said in that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change yet wednesday the white house will celebrate earth day and promote its work to fend off climate change while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions nuclear energy as well as the warning of one of the administration s favorite climate scientists despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon free the obama administration s energy policy plan is biased against it this bias is created by how environmental protection agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation epa s modeling is divorced from reality first epa s base case for the proposed clean power plan purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the clean power plan this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of of our operating nuclear plants by epa s implementation modeling option state shows exactly the same situation no new construction and retirements by in other words epa assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets a group of university of tennessee graduate students made this point to epa at a public hearing last summer using epa s own data the graduate students showed that epa s energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants the students demonstrated that under this scenario epa s model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase president obama s epa has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model for example when epa modeled the lieberman warner bill in the agency indicated nuclear plants would need to be built by in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill epa s modeling of the waxman markey bill showed the need to build new nuclear plants by to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation where did this policy shift come from at a recent hearing in the environment and public works committee mary nichols chairman of the california air resources board told congress that epa looked at california s california global warming solutions act when developing its so called clean power plan and that epa s plan adopts the same policy choices limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower both of which are carbon free thus epa is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon free energy over others congress did not give epa the authority to make these choices so instead they have hidden them in the modeling for example the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only to years before needing replacement this anti nuclear bias also is evident in obama s recent executive order planning for federal sustainability in the next decade which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon free electricity the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon i believe in an all of the above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air the administration says it shares these same interests despite differing avenues to get there the administration also believes in man driven global warming which should make nuclear energy its golden key but the clean power plan and the president s recent executive order demonstrate that the obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all of the above energy strategy if you think this administration supports nuclear energy think again
u s president barack obama s recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region in his interview with tom friedman from the new york times on april obama explained u s foreign policy moves on iran and cuba which friedman described as the obama doctrine he stated that we will engage but we preserve all our capabilities by capabilities the president must mean the tools whether diplomatic economic or military to protect and defend u s interests the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the u s policy under the rest of obama s presidency instead of the new beginning that the president outlined in his much discussed cairo speech in u s policy in the middle east remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground for example the president asserted in the interview that the u s s core interests in the region are not oil are not territorial our core interests are that everybody is living in peace that it is orderly that our allies are not being attacked that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them that massive displacements aren t taking place yet at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment u s allies such as the arab gulf states jordan lebanon and the legitimate government in yemen found themselves under serious threat and attack the syrian regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens and the middle east was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history implementing the core u s interests outlined by obama in the interview is clearly not working there exist grave doubts about whether the current u s administration is indeed ready to deploy the above mentioned capabilities it seems that the u s will only use them when its national security is at stake and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president the use of drone technology across the region the military strikes being conducted against isis in iraq and syria and the framework agreement between iran and six world powers on the iranian nuclear programs are cases in point establishing a region living in peace is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the so called obama doctrine in the same vein the majority of the arab world and the entire gulf region look at the recently announced iran nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation having directly experienced the problematic interventionist iranian policies for decades the arab world is simply not ready to give tehran the benefit of doubt on any regional issue but neither is it ready to trust u s assurances that outside a nuclear agreement the u s will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain iranian influence throughout the region or to defend the gulf cooperation council gcc states against any iranian threat instead the fear is that as long as iran abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year the u s will negate downplay or simply ignore those iranian actions that the arab world considers as direct threats here actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from washington at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the arab world when he referred to our sunni arab allies the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying populations that in some cases are alienated youth that are underemployed an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic and in some cases just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances what obama failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to iran in his interview he never questioned iran s appalling record on human rights treatment of the political opposition and minorities rights among other disturbing issues moreover the reference to saudi arabia being one of the sunni arab allies ignores the fact that there are non sunnis living in the arab gulf and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the non sunni arabs equally the assertion that the biggest threats that they the arab states face may not be coming from iran invading it s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries is another example of the detachment from reality based on a gulf research center study when there are militia groups supported by iran operating in iraq and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country it is simply naive to suggest there is no iranian threat the bottom line here is that u s and arab national security interests are no longer on the same page ever since the u s led invasion of iraq in those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the arab world is tired of false promises the ongoing operation of ten mostly arab coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of yemen is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of arab countries to take matters in their own hands the gcc states may accept the invitation by the u s president to come to camp david his maryland country retreat and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them the truth of the matter is that the region is not working and that misguided u s leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region unfortunately the obama doctrine does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse
marco rubio is all in the republican senator from florida has announced that he is seeking the republican presidential nomination running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the american dream with his youthful energy and hispanic roots it s tempting to see rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in yet rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues immigration reform and cuba relations he holds little appeal to latino voters and unless he can offer new ideas his climb to the republican nomination will be steep back in rubio was a member of the senate gang of that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform including a path to citizenship for the nation s estimated million undocumented immigrants he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from house republicans and now says he favors a piecemeal approach starting with securing the border his retreat on immigration means that rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive republican presidential candidates that s a shame for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to latino voters instead rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration he believes that president obama s deferred action program offering deportation relief to young immigrants should be ended he has stated that the president s executive action on immigration on hold pending a circuit court review sets a horrifying precedent meanwhile both the deferred action program and president obama s executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by hispanics no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that we find no evidence that rubio s candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally so if rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow hispanics he is mistaken at a private breakfast monday for supporters rubio described running against one candidate in the race who s from yesterday and one who wants to take us back to yesterday but when it comes to cuba policy rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past over the weekend he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous he has warned that cuba is taking advantage of the united states here he is an increasingly lonely voice most americans support better relations with cuba as do a majority of cuban americans by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership immigration and cuba policy aside rubio s political philosophy will be a tough sell to hispanics he is a fierce opponent of obamacare and wants the law repealed however the affordable care act has led to a drop in the hispanic uninsured rate making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance thanks to the law in fact rubio signed his own family up for obamacare on the washington exchange taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers rubio favors smaller government while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less and though rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue sure rubio is young and charismatic but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate in february he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website politico another rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals consider that his fellow contender for the gop presidential nomination sen rand paul of kentucky has been willing to present new ideas to the republican base such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana or that another gop candidate for president sen ted cruz of texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand by comparison rubio seems cautious and ill suited to the task of rousing republican voters with his early leap into the race marco rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of gop leadership unfortunately a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination not for rubio and not for latino voters

attack i don t think i have a left foot anymore she told her father i m in really bad shape and i really need to talk to you because this might be it her father told her he was driving and it was

be it for me haslet davis told the jury that at the forum her husband kept telling her he was sorry that was all he could say that he loved me he was so sorry her husband she said has since bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the va hospital after her testimony haslet davis walked slowly off the stand she appeared to glare at tsarnaev who did not look at her earlier this week prosecutors showed jurors an image of tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell it was dated july the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs he glares into the camera defiantly his middle finger raised in a gesture that assistant u s attorney nadine pellegrini said showed a young man who was unconcerned unrepentant and unchanged on wednesday tsarnaev s lawyer miriam conrad sought to discredit the use of the image she suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context on cross examination of a deputy u s marshal conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken in it tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair moments before he has two fingers up forming what conrad called a v sign before raising his middle finger gary olivera a deputy u s marshal for years admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror a lot of times people do that to get our attention olivera said also wednesday jinyan zhao told the jury about her niece lingzi lu a beautiful nerd and graduate student at boston university who was killed in the bombing lingzi lu was originally from china but was buried in boston how she died and why she died it just felt like she is part of boston part of city her aunt said the thinking is she should just be here the family zhao said put a music box and some books in her casket her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand later her mother described her beautiful hand zhao recalled what lu s mother said to her no matter what i don t want to believe it is her hand the brother and stepfather of sean collier also took the stand wednesday collier was the mit police officer who was shot in his patrol car another victim of the tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture sean collier always wanted to be a cop said his brother he was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong either you did it or you didn t we thought it was typical little boy stuff but he never grew out of it andrew collier told the jury sean was always the one to spill the beans said joe rodgers who married collier s mother kelly in he was a cop from an early age on a thursday night in april massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head his car door was open and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals the officer who found collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple neck and head he was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him collier would become the fourth victim of the tsarnaev brothers the night still feels like a dream for rodgers he had a hole in the middle of his head rodgers said he was shot to pieces he was just laying there my wife was touching him and his blood was coming up in her hands prosecution shows what it calls tsarnaev s defiant message to u s prosecutors said the brothers killed collier because they wanted his gun but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster tamerlan was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an officer down at mit less than two weeks after tsarneav was found guilty on every count the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds earlier mit police chief john difava told the jury that he hired collier who fit in perfectly because of his policing style and engaging personality the mit police who are designated as special officers by the massachusetts state police patrol the sprawling campus in cambridge the atmosphere of the department changed since april he said there is sadness and a sense of loss i think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains it was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community but sean s death hangs like a weight difava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force policing is the only thing i ve done in my life and i ve always tried to be good at what i do he said i lost one of my own i have children at home and i ve always thought i would have been very very proud for them to wear the uniform now i m not so sure rodgers said it took his wife kelly months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing she cried all weekend she was very strong he said she was a happy person she was a good mother since sean s death she s very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children kelly became pregnant with sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two rodgers said his birth lifted her out of depression he was special he said adding that sean is now buried alongside the baby rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later there s something missing he said thanksgiving and christmas will never be the same collier s brother andrew said even when we re having fun there s always a cloud over us i miss sean i miss everything about him the prosecution is expected to rest friday according to an official with insight into the prosecutor s plans poll say tsarnaev should face death penalty ann o neill and aaron cooper reported from boston ray sanchez wrote in new york
robert bates shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police bates was a reserve deputy sheriff which allowed him to work full time jobs in the community and volunteer time in a myriad of events such as the special olympics and tulsa state fair according to the tulsa county sheriff office s website but bates wasn t limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled he had taken part in more than operations with the violent crimes task force according to his lawyer on april bates thought he was going to use a taser on eric harris who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a lugar pistol and then took off running but bates wasn t holding a taser he was holding his gun he fired one shot and killed harris from a policing perspective there wasn t even good reason to use a taser against harris cops were on scene harris wasn t getting the upper hand he wasn t going anywhere and despite what bates would later claim harris was not running like a man with a gun in fact harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband what was bates an insurance company ceo doing there in the first place it certainly looks like bates was given special access to real policing harris had given to sheriff stanley glanz s re election campaign he donated cars to the department he gave equipment so it would be noteworthy if bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by sunglass cameras that he may have purchased for the department a tulsa police official said the agency has reserve deputies many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police that s not unusual at all he told the tulsa world maybe bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything but i doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force he was too old to be policing the streets tulsa police said that bates had served a year in as a police officer most police departments have mandatory retirement ages federal law enforcement officers for instance retire at how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers for one thing it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free but departments also know that you get what you pay for what is the point of background checks psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol some people are a little too eager to be police officers these people perhaps buy a police like car for their personal car maybe they put in a police light or two some have actually made car stops police departments hate cop impersonators it s illegal by the way and try and weed them during the hiring process you want workers who like the job but not too much there s a fine line between passion and fanaticism that said there are good volunteer police officers new york city for example has auxiliary police these officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities they wear an nypd uniform but do not carry a gun auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized swat officers an auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge it can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn t for them before they are locked into a year commitment what happened in tulsa county is a disgrace to police professionalism and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs that would be a mistake police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public but a line does need to be drawn
thinking about presidential candidates apparently hormones are a major factor one should consider according to one female businesswoman in texas hillary clinton shouldn t be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she ll start an unnecessary war when george w bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq was his testosterone to blame as cheryl rios the ceo of go ape marketing sees it we re built differently we have different hormones in the world that we live in i understand that there s equal rights and that s a wonderful thing and i support all of that i don t support a woman being president with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war rios wrote in a facebook post if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office she d be better off worrying about the male candidates for president throughout history male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders decision making studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts if science doesn t convince you just google cheating politicians for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger mark sanford and john edwards whose hormones got the best of them rios has taken a lot of flak for her biblically inspired beliefs but she s not the only one who s arguing that a woman s hormones are a legitimate leadership concern time magazine declared hillary clinton the perfect age to be president because she s a postmenopausal woman who is biologically primed to lead she also happens to be a former first lady senator and secretary of state i m not joking believe me i wish i were no wonder jon stewart left the daily show before the election cycle ramps up in full swing if discussions about a candidate s hormones are what we have to look forward to the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in a female candidate will be hard pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything and you d think they could they outnumber boys in college graduate school and the work force but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability but a bias in how women and girls are viewed unfortunately cheryl rios view of women is not unique some people believe women have our place and that place is not at the table they ll tell your daughter to go for it but believe she isn t qualified to fulfill her dreams in a compelling series about women and work wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless it s overt there are more men on corporate boards named john robert william or james than there are women on boards altogether the bias is also covert when students rate their favorite professors they describe the men as geniuses and the women as nice the bias is real yet so many of us are blind to it hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb that s not just a problem for democrats it s a problem for republicans independents everyone the fact is equality benefits everyone it s better for the bottom line companies with more women in leadership roles make more money it s great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier healthier and more successful it s great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages and it s great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results our nation our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men it s not enough to say to our daughters you can be anything you want to be what we need to say is you can be anything you want to be despite what some people might think and what they think is wrong rios said that if clinton is elected she is moving to canada because a female shouldn t be president apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada kim campbell became the country s first female prime minister in correction an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister kim campbell

the nfl draft begins on april and while the tampa bay buccaneers are on the clock with the no overall pick the clock is still ticking for another team the new england patriots as they await the results of the deflategate investigation which has already lasted more than three months in january the nfl launched an investigation into the patriots to determine why of the game balls they provided for the afc championship game were underinflated the league hired attorney ted wells who also investigated the miami dolphins bullying scandal to run the investigation jeff pash the nfl s executive vice president and chief counsel is assisting wells in the effort the league has also retained renaissance associates an investigatory firm with sophisticated forensic expertise to assist in reviewing electronic and video information but three months later it s still not clear when the investigation will be completed and when the findings will be announced we have not put a time frame on ted wells nfl commissioner roger goodell said march we asked him to be thorough complete and when he is finished with that he ll give that to us and to the public in general on monday cnn reached out to wells and the nfl for an update on the investigation but has not heard back on january the patriots beat the indianapolis colts to advance to the super bowl they scored of their points in the second half after game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure so it s unlikely that the ball pressure made much difference in the outcome of the game in february colts general manager ryan grigson said at the nfl combine in indianapolis that prior to the afc championship game his team notified the league of its concerns about the footballs we went into the game we had some issues but we are going to do what we can and that s to participate with the league and the investigation and wait until the wells report comes out grigson said february we really have no other recourse than to wait until that investigation comes out each team provides a dozen footballs to the referee for testing two hours and minutes before kickoff the home team also supplies backup balls and for outdoor games the visiting team has the option of bringing another balls nfl rules state the referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications a pump is to be furnished by the home club and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game the ball attendant brings the footballs to the field and ball boys keep them on the sideline it s been speculated that deflated footballs are easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers however there isn t a consensus by players on that view the day after the afc championship game patriots quarterback tom brady called the accusation of using deflated footballs ridiculous a few days later he told reporters he has always played by the rules following a practice on january patriots head coach bill belichick said that the patriots try to do everything right at no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage belichick said at the time quite the opposite we feel like we follow the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations in our procedures after arriving in arizona for super bowl xlix patriots owner robert kraft said he expects the nfl to apologize if the investigation does not uncover any wrongdoing many jump to conclusions and made strong accusations against our coach quarterback and staff questioning the integrity of all involved kraft said then if the wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs i would expect and hope the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach belichick and tom brady for what they have had to endure this past week in terms of punishment the patriots could be fined and or docked a draft pick after spygate in where the patriots illegally videotaped the new york jets defensive coaches signals the league took away a patriots first round draft pick fined the team and fined belichick however it s not expected that the punishment would be that serious for deflategate in march two other teams were punished by the nfl for different rules violations cleveland browns general manager ryan farmer admitted to using his phone to text the browns staffers during games during the season it s against the rules to use certain electronic devices during games farmer will be suspended without pay for the first four regular season games of the season and the browns were fined during the suspension farmer cannot be involved in any team matters and is prohibited from being at the browns offices practice facility or at browns games according to the league there was no evidence in the nfl s review that browns ownership or any other team executives had knowledge of the prohibited conduct the atlanta falcons acknowledged the use of prerecorded crowd noise which is also a violation of nfl rules during home games in the and into the season the rule states that at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium the falcons were fined and lose their fifth round draft pick in the nfl draft the league s investigation found that the falcons former director of event marketing was directly responsible but that senior executives including team president rich mckay were unaware of the use of the piped in crowd noise still mckay was suspended from the nfl competition committee starting april starting june he can petition goodell for reinstatement to the committee as to what happens to the patriots and when it s still anyone s guess but goodell has previously stated that a violation of rules will be taken seriously whenever there is a charge potentially of the violations of our rules we take it very seriously and that s our obligation goodell said in march that s our obligation to the other clubs ted wells will be going through the report if there is anything that we as a league did incorrectly we will know about it in that report what the heck is deflategate

have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future should she change her mind loeb said he believes that life begins at fertilization he said creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations even where a man doesn t want to become a father where a man does want to become a father and wants to impose no obligations on the other party he should have that corresponding right however life comes to be created it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent loeb said in an interview with abc in april while the couple was still engaged vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it we just wanted to plan ahead my boyfriend nick is three years younger than me and he s never had a son i have my son manolo so it s not that import ant you know it s not like an emergency for me to have another kid for nick yes because he s never had a baby vergara said during the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with loeb i already froze some eggs so you know i wanted to take advantage of science why not vergara said the abc anchor asked vergara how far along she was in the process to which the actress replied i took them out already they re in a refrigerator laughing she added hopefully they ll be fresh by the time i use them the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos typically a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority said fertility specialist dr david tourgeman who s not involved in this case usually when embryos are created whether the couple is married or just consenting adults there s usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos if they are frozen for future use he said in most cases the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney although anyone can make a request tourgeman said if there s a disagreement the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos he said the documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners he said in the scenario where there s a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to it will usually be decided by a court of law but experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues religious moral issues to legal and contract issues when does life begin are these embryos alive said california attorney vance owen to catholics for example conception marks the beginning of life to abortion advocates the child has to be in a more advanced state perhaps the third trimester so it s a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues owen said owen said loeb has a case because no court in california will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree this case is a gray area of law because it s new owen said it s developing as we speak he said it s a question i think of whether to decide if these frozen embryos are human beings or whether they are property since they are unborn some states in the united states look at these embryos not as life but as property owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by loeb will now open new issues and a california court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong these embryos are not inside her body he said they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in beverly hills so there the planned parenthood of central missouri vs danforth case cannot be used by the sofia vergara team to allege that the embryos would present some danger to her health as they did in that case in that case the u s supreme court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional the lawsuit comes as vergara promotes her new movie hot pursuit with co star reese

it s clear from hillary clinton s campaign rollout a video announcement campaign ad short film that debuted sunday afternoon that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach in case you re skeptical vox has posted a handy by the numbers for her campaign video and there are people besides clinton in the two minute ad twenty of them are women there are three separate mentions of motherhood this is all fine and good and predictable if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since and let s not overlook the fact that clinton is in fact a woman and that s a fine thing to celebrate but in reality she doesn t have to wonder if a woman centered campaign is the best strategy she can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible voting population failed spectacularly all over the country in red and blue states when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates as i ve previously written the midterm elections saw the death of a political meme the war on women granted that s not because republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women but it is noteworthy that democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues and men crashed and burned to wit in colorado sen mark udall was nicknamed mark uterus for all the time he spent fear mongering on women s reproductive issues only to end up according to exit polls eight points ahead among women his opponent cory gardner finished points ahead among men in new york a democratic candidate for congress martha robertson drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a war on women to repeat she was a woman a democrat in new york in louisiana sen mary landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for democrats lack of popularity in the south not surprisingly southerners voted for her opponent bill cassidy in texas where liberal wendy davis ran almost entirely on an abortion rights platform she accused republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography her opponent greg abbott won by points and davis only ended up with of the women vote whether in texas or colorado new york or louisiana voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren t going to be bullied into voting democratic by false cries of sexism but while democrats were screaming about the republicans war on women few in the media acknowledged that the democrats deficit among men was actually greater than the republicans deficit among women exit polls in showed that men voted for republicans over democrats by a point margin and women voted for democrats by only a four point margin regardless of whom republicans run for president hillary clinton will most likely get the women vote what she needs are men so instead of running a woman centered campaign she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex

on april a final cement seal of an oil well in the gulf of mexico failed causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in u s history and taking the lives of rig workers for straight days oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead mile below the surface of the ocean the federal government estimated million barrels of oil spilled into the gulf but bp argued in court that it was much lower a judge ruled bp was responsible for the release of million barrels imagining daddy a rig worker s daughter and her dreams there were dire predictions of what would follow environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale scientists continue to study environmental impacts but five years after the spill the long term negative effects remain unclear and are in many cases highly disputed bp the company that caused the spill is eager to point out it appears the gulf of mexico is healing itself bp s vice president of communications geoff morrell said there is no doubt birds fish turtles sub sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill email your story ideas and tips to cnntips cnn com there s no question about that morrell said but they have also according to the data bounced back and are recovering strongly and there is no data that suggests there are any long term population level impacts to any species while bp s assessment has not been disproven the government suggests it s too soon to make long term conclusions about the rebounding health of the gulf shortly after bp released its own five year report that concluded the gulf has largely recovered the trustees of the natural resource damage assessment called bp s report inappropriate as well as premature the trustees a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the macondo spill released a statement saying we know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations one government official familiar with the trustee s assessment accused bp of having cherry picked positive results while ignoring others something bp denies most long term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill but others show some of those species are bouncing back fish landings in the gulf the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry have returned oysters are also recovering in many areas and according to the food and drug administration tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region s food supply the spill s effects on other species are less clear dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the gulf coast and even more so in louisiana where the oil hit the hardest but the dolphin mortality event as the government calls it began months before the spill studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like barataria bay louisiana could be caused by oil exposure but direct links to the macondo spill have not been proven seaside sparrows in the gulf are also showing signs of strain and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance while aerial surveys taken in suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long term effects on sea turtle populations but perhaps the greatest unknown is what if anything millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the gulf itself oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean mandy joye an oceanographer with the university of georgia has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled her research and other studies show bp s oil is scattered in patches across more than square miles of the seafloor according to joye s study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor estimated to be about million gallons affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean that stuff s not going to stay put it s going to move around joye said she said that right now there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact there s so much that we don t know joye said bp doesn t accept the results of joye s work the company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places within a kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach and according to bp s morrell the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful so much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life morrell said ocean conservationist philippe cousteau witnessed much of the spill s aftermath in but when he returned to the gulf to dive near an oil rig last month he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw during the same trip however cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf it is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill but he said he believes it s far too early to say the gulf is back and the oil is gone it is still in many cases in the sand along the shoreline in the marshes cousteau said and existing on a microscopic scale that

diamond to start an investment fund focused on africa called atlas mara the powerful duo raised million through a share flotation well above the million target but his vision spans beyond africa and earth thakkar was the first african to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with richard branson s company virgin galactic cnn s marketplace africa spoke to thakkar about african innovation entrepreneurship and collaboration an edited version of the interview follows cnn you are active in several african countries how is the current business landscape on the continent ashish thakkar right now in the last years i have been active on the continent i have never seen so much global excitement around africa that i ve seen today the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved unfortunately it s one of those cases where perception is so different from reality the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception you ve got to remember as africa we are countries some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit cnn why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the african continent at we have a very young demographic of our populations are under the age of we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture yet entrepreneurship is not in the education system where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance and it s something frankly that i am extremely passionate about because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants etc it s going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises so it s great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system and innovation is totally embedded into that cnn what is it about africa that encourages innovation at the biggest advantage we have at the moment and you ve seen this with mobile phone penetration is that we don t have legacy systems we didn t have landlines and we didn t need them we didn t have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony today we have over million phones on the continent more than north america and western europe put together we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways mobile money is another brilliant example mobile money was created in kenya the whole concept of having money on your phone which is the best thing because it s secure it s practical made more sense so these kind of innovations you re going to see a lot more of on the continent i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they re coming up with is just so inspiring cnn what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who s just starting out at entrepreneurship is a journey it s not a destination there are going to be so many challenges you are going to get knocked down so many times but you ve got to get up dust yourself off and get back to it the persistence the passion and staying on course is very crucial you ll be tempted to cut corners you ll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker but it never lasts people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow we re not we re the leaders of today but it s our responsibility to take the seat at the table cnn what needs to be done most urgently to grow african economies at pan african collaboration is extremely important i think things like regional integration inter african trade does need to increase and is increasing i mean the progress in the east african community has been amazing the manner in which they ve harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic so we need to see more of that take place on the continent the fact that we re countries yet we re a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage i think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial cnn are you confident about the future of the continent at i am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership the mindset of our leaders it is so inspiring to see that it s unfortunate that you know globally the highlight remains things like ebola the little issues that we do have are just magnified yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing cnn is this africa s century at mara s logo is the african lion and our little joke which a lot of people don t appreciate hence i love it even more is that the indian tiger and the chinese

well the thought experiments are finally over hillary clinton s online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign should she win clinton will add to her potential firsts first woman president the first president who had been a first lady there s another one too the first secretary of state to become president since james buchanan only a handful of the nation s top diplomats have gone to the white house thomas jefferson james madison james monroe john quincy adams martin van buren and buchanan and none in the th century a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire ambition and temperament to compete for the top job still on balance clinton s tenure at the state department should be a real advantage during the campaign particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective republican rivals but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side clinton will have to negotiate and traverse several tricky and rocky paths to ensure that her state department career remains an advantage and doesn t turn into a liability here s why the last president to serve in a top job in the administration of his immediate predecessor was george h w bush circumstances were different then far from wanting to distance himself from reagan bush saw merit in reinforcing the association with a president who dominated his day in a way few chief executives have clinton will face a harder balancing act how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obama s first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak vacillating and fairly or not responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse especially in the middle east and with russia than when president obama took office in the process she ll have to define her own approach to the world indeed given the president s vulnerabilities on foreign policy she can t afford to be seen as obama s third term in her memoir hard choices she s already laid the foundation for distancing herself from obama on issues such as doing more for the syrian opposition and being tougher on russia s vladimir putin and she can legitimately work to sharpen those differences without seeming to walk away from policies she supported and leaving herself open to charges that she has no principles only politically expedient tactics too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her but so will flip flopping nowhere will her challenges be greater than on iran clinton presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the november interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the united states and iran earlier this month in lausanne switzerland and she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced iran to the table the problem of course is that her republican opponents and more than a few democrats hate what the negotiations have produced much less enamored with the obama s let s engage our enemies trope clinton may have doubts herself the good news is that there won t be an agreement for months so for now she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse should the iranians cheat but sooner or later perhaps as early as june if there s an agreement clinton will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what congress role should be her opponents the israelis and much of the organized jewish community will portray it as even worse and that is likely to be somewhat problematic and will be hyped as even worse and this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the jewish community frankly given her political interests it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough anti iranian message hammering the mullahs repressive policies at home and their mischief making in the region she may not be that lucky still she will have an advantage in dealing with the pro israeli community unlike president obama the clintons have strong credentials on the israeli issue and that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with iran that clinton launched and its fruits which are seen by many israelis and american jews right now as too generous to the mullahs clinton s time at the state department should help her in a presidential campaign where americans are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the white house the republicans will try and show that benghazi and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she didn t accomplish much clinton wasn t a henry kissinger or a james baker but given the problems she confronted iran stalled israeli palestinian two state negotiations none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy she performed ably enough she improved the nation s image and pushed st century issues such as women s rights youth and the environment her critics will dismiss all this as a kind of naive planetary humanism still four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead america in a dangerous and turbulent world and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs that can only help clinton s biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk readiness of george w bush and the risk aversion of barack obama and given the cruel and unforgiving nature of the world america now inhabits this will be no easy task

here s a pop quiz what s better for america s status in the world a being a global leader in innovation job creation education social mobility literacy and child health b being a global leader in imprisoning the highest number of human beings its own citizens it s an obvious answer but the unfortunate reality is that the united states leads the world in incarceration not education our country has shown time and again a nearly unlimited capacity to reinvent itself and move closer to the ideals on which our society was founded yet we have emerged as the global leader in a race that no nation would want to even be a contender in while our country is home to only of the world s total population we are home to of the world s prison population and nearly three fourths of this population is comprised of nonviolent offenders at the same time we are losing the increasingly important race to educate our citizens where the united states was once ranked first in high school graduation rates we now rank rd in high school completion among of the world s most developed nations where we were once the driving force of the global economy we now rank fifth in the world economic forum s global competitiveness index key metrics in this index include the quality of a nation s primary secondary and higher education systems instead of empowering the next generation of american artists scientists engineers inventors and entrepreneurs our country has chosen to devote a massive amount of resources time and energy to locking people up by imprisoning individuals we also burden families condemn generations to cycles of poverty and breed economic inequality in the s and s congress chose to adopt laws that drastically changed the way our country handled nonviolent drug crimes since then the american prison population has increased by nearly over the past years over million american children have a parent who is incarcerated and million american children at one time in their lives had a parent in prison americans of color are disproportionately burdened by the failures of our justice system there are more black men in prison or under state or federal supervision today than there were enslaved in and while african americans make up only of the total u s population they make up a whopping of the u s prison population the sad reality is that in today s america prisoners are never truly free from the burdens of our criminal justice system a report from the center for economic and policy research concluded that once released from prison an ex offender s prospects for obtaining employment statistically decreased the report estimated that in ex offender employment losses cost our economy the equivalent of to million workers or billion to billion annually it s therefore no surprise that american prisons have become revolving doors with two out of every three former offenders rearrested within three years of their release the millions of wives sisters husbands daughters sons friends and the people they love who have been incarcerated are burdened disproportionately by an outdated archaic and overly punitive system these millions of americans have the ability to advance our country our economy and our global competitiveness they just need to be given the opportunity american taxpayers aren t free from the burdens of our criminal justice system either in addition to the billions lost in jobs and productivity americans spend over a quarter of a trillion dollars each year to keep millions of nonviolent low level offenders imprisoned the price tag is truly staggering it costs on average a year to house one inmate at the federal level in contrast our country spends a little over dollars a year per elementary school student imagine the good we could do if we could re appropriate those tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and economic losses away from imprisonment and toward investment in our children s future we must start to deconstruct the perverse order of our priorities and build a more just society by making needed changes at the federal level we must examine the way our criminal justice system works or rather doesn t and take the necessary actions to change it fortunately there is already a road map for successfully addressing these problems we know reforms will work because they already are in states across the country in both blue states such as new jersey and connecticut and red states such as texas and georgia state and local officials have developed and instituted sweeping reforms that have reduced their prison populations and crime rates they are succeeding by focusing their efforts on areas where the criminal justice system most needs reform we should follow their example on the federal level first we should pass legislation that promotes front end reform such as ending mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug crimes secondly we should pass legislation that enacts behind the wall reforms such as eradicating the cruel practice of juvenile solitary confinement and thirdly we should enact back end reforms with legislation that assists in sealing criminal records and removing barriers to employment for nonviolent formerly incarcerated people as we reform our criminal justice system at the national level we will alter the cycles of poverty and recidivism that plague too many american communities and start to develop virtuous cycles of excellence instead of putting resources toward juvenile detention centers we can put resources toward afterschool programs that have proved to help keep kids out of the juvenile justice system and in school instead of losing valuable contributors to our economy because of their status as ex offenders we can develop apprenticeship and training programs that improve worker skills and jump start our economy instead of asking american taxpayers to pay for warehousing people who commit nonviolent low

washington cnn decision time for gop operatives another controversial foreign policy choice for president obama a ripple effect from the robert menendez indictment and two insights into hillary clinton s campaign launch those stories filled our sunday trip around the inside politics table obama s iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead the president is headed to panama for a regional summit and julie pace of the associated press reports one of the big questions is whether he ll make history and have a face to face meeting with cuban leader raul castro this would be the first meeting between a u s and a cuban leader in decades said pace but obama s efforts to end this freeze of cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year pace said and so what the white house is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the castros hillary clinton has leased her headquarters space in brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official and with the launch jonathan martin of the new york times reports will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce clinton with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children s issues the democrats around hillary clinton believe that while she s one of the most famous people in the world she s never been properly introduced in her own right said martin so when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks look for more biographical touches we ll hear about her childhood in suburban chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the legal services corporation and the children s defense fund when she was in her s and also more about her arkansas days as first lady as an advocate for education a lot of the big names signing on to team clinton are already known but dan balz of the washington post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles what i m hearing is that when they launch this staff is going to be even much much bigger than we at this point imagine that they have done a huge amount of hiring said balz and balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction she did an event with the wife of the mayor of new york earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they re doing much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against democratic sen robert menendez of new jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends but beyond the more tabloidesque details jackie kucinich of the daily beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator s staff was soliciting funds for a so called super pac a violation of campaign finance laws and she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the menendez allegations i was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the federal election commission really starts to look into this they re actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than menendez said kucinich so watch for that if it starts happening by a week from monday there will be three official gop candidates for president ted cruz rand paul and marco rubio others will soon follow and as things get more official pressure is mounting on gop operatives to choose sides in new hampshire this past week matt maroney a former mitt romney alum with ground organizing experience signed on with new jersey gov chris christie s team others in the state reported calls coming in from ohio gov john kasich and yes even donald trump this dynamic plays out on the national level too republican pollster tony fabrizio for example was approached both by team christie and by allies of wisconsin gov scott walker in the end though fabrizio signed on with sen rand paul of kentucky who makes his official announcement on tuesday

most companies in south korea have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week literally this means dinner with co workers in practice it means official eating drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues for the foreign business traveler using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far the pressure to participate is intense drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests says bryan do a korean american director at the south korean branch of a u s company it was shocking when i first arrived in korea my boss was a graduate of korea university renowned for its hardy drinking culture and at my first hoesik we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju and downing it on the spot that was just the beginning for koreans drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like i didn t really like it in the beginning says charles lee a korean canadian who came to seoul to work for a south korean company i was like why are you making me drink something when i don t want to but once i understood the meaning behind it i appreciated it more there are just some things you can t say at work or talk about over lunch people who talk about work at lunch are losers but when someone offers you a glass of soju it s an invitation that means that they want to listen to you i thought koreans were impersonal before i drank with them so the whole context is important drinking is such a big part of korean life that seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city s drinking culture mondays are a big night for hoesik so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking tuesdays are a rest day while wednesday and thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking fridays have the worst evening traffic as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend so how do you avoid offending someone worst of all a superior or client at a korean drinking extravaganza follow these seven handy rules koreans always identify the higher person in the relationship and defer to them accordingly one of the first things koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect though age is always superseded by a higher position it s considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass if a senior person is pouring this usually pertains to hard liquor only others shouldn t drink until someone has poured the senior a shot after all glasses are full everyone says gunbae and chugs usually one shotting the entire glass in one go while downing alcohol you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands by raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand you are establishing yourself as a senior person if you re not well you ve just breached protocol it s always a good idea to find out people s drinking habits beforehand it shouldn t be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol i e round one is dinner accompanied by beer round two is soju round three is for whiskey and so on be ready for each unless you have an airtight reason refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude sorry but i don t like soju doesn t qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver neither would i ve been on the wagon for three years in fact unless you re pregnant or already puking what might be a good reason not to imbibe elsewhere often won t fly here it s generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol under the table into your water cup out the window than to refuse it one of the most popular venues in korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar koreans love singing as evidenced by the country s staggering number of karaoke bars as well as the rush of audition programs on korean television your companions won t rest until you sing they ll coax threaten push and cajole until you finally take that mic be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure if you simply cannot take any more you can call a black knight male or a black rose female to your rescue this entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you but it also means they get a wish as in you might soon wish you d just taken that last shot as you re spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client bottoms up christopher cha is a korean american writer based in seoul

this week hillary clinton surprised the world yet again not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it she sure pushed the envelope with her video new logo and road trip she opened a long communications campaign not only to rebrand herself but to completely reframe who she is what she stands for and how she intends to run we ll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work many in the press and on late night television scratched their heads this week others were scathing ruth marcus a columnist for the washington post dismissed her launch video as a relentlessly insultingly vapid effort of demographic box checking jon stewart lampooned it as a state farm commercial gone viral and also boring as s since the media will likely be the stand in primary opponent for hillary their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter s eyes but from a marketing perspective her launch may have been much more successful than critics think the youtube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate to flip clinton s message from self absorbed i to empathetic we while critics may sneer it is hard to deny that the image it projects of hillary is more confident fresher simpler and forward looking with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies nike and apple clinton s team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to barack obama in in marketing terms rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name term symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers reframing is a strategy that goes further it seeks to change how a consumer or voter emotionally experiences an established brand a rebrand may change how you think about a brand a reframe may change how you feel about it in the apple case the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original macintosh some thought the company was headed for oblivion but when steve jobs returned as ceo he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the ipod which not only changed the way consumers thought about apple but how they experienced it not only a rebrand but a reframe take hillary s road trip to iowa in the van nicknamed scooby the press lampooned her but i would bet that for many others her unscripted and anonymous stop at chipotle reinforced the everyday americans campaign theme hillary stood in line to order an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast food chain also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most ubiquitous element of her campaign clinton s new and controversial campaign logo it is a brilliant iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her her message and her movement in fact her logo is all about movement simple confident high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue h says it all you are the important ones i m here to support you with everything i ve got let me help you move forward taken together all the pieces of clinton s announcement as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but surprisingly as one for the future coincidentally the way marco rubio announced his run for the republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of clinton s reframing for all his posturing about being the new generation rubio followed to a t the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy traditional stage and podium dark suit bright tie wife and kids on camera a live speech all about himself timed for the evening news rubio s logo the signature of his image drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered even leaving alaska and hawaii off the map of america in stark contrast hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front it was hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu jitsu there are those of course who will be alienated if not disgusted by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan in a day when voters are yearning for authenticity how do we know this is the real hillary or a candidate in a mask fair question but for better or worse mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns that s where most campaign dollars go both sides know how to play sometimes brilliantly remember the reagan advertisements of proclaiming morning in america what we know is that over time voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate that campaign will get into trouble fast that s why the key to hillary clinton s success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency she must not only take the essence of a humble empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication she must also live it every day otherwise there will be messaging schizophrenia the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she ll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in in the meantime one can imagine clinton getting a huge satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts

in case you needed a reminder that president barack obama isn t running for office again he just alienated not only republicans who have largely resented him from day one but the progressive base of democratic voters obama has argued with the progressive potentate elizabeth warren calling her wrong on trade policy the massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom hillary clinton has been religiously prostrating what everyone does next will be critical for the elections and the future of democratic politics warren has publicly criticized so called fast track trade authority that would allow the white house to negotiate massive multination trade deals with little congressional oversight the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the trans pacific partnership which is modeled on the north american free trade agreement and has killed american jobs and drove wages down in the united states while simultaneously decimating mexican agriculture and small businesses aspects of the tpp deal would provide incentives for off shoring jobs to low wage countries imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply don t like in december warren wrote a letter signed by several other democrats to u s trade representative michael froman raising concerns about the tpp the letter warned that the tpp could erode safeguards that have been put in place to prevent future financial crises we cannot afford a trade deal that undermines the government s ability to protect the american economy warren wrote at a town hall with msnbc s chris matthews on tuesday president obama said i love elizabeth we re allies on a whole host of issues but she s wrong on this obama added when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is when you dig into the facts they are wrong but i m right and she s wrong doesn t exactly come off as a thoughtful let alone respectful response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the democratic party today meanwhile hillary clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle clinton has recently courted warren s support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism but according to a report by the new york times clinton s staff is at pains to suggest that clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co opt a current trend yet it becomes harder to paint clinton as the original elizabeth warren each time she equivocates on trade policy and the tpp in a speech as secretary of state clinton praised the tpp as the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field but now as she campaigns for president facing a democratic electorate divided over the deal clinton is sounding more critical any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security clinton said this week so does clinton support the tpp deal or not campaigning in new hampshire on tuesday clinton reportedly declined to say one way or the other that s not the behavior of a fierce populist it s more indicative of the sort of politically calculated ideologically centrist triangulation for which her husband was famous seizing on clinton s ambiguity her potential challenger in the democratic primary martin o malley released a video this week making clear that he is against the tpp according to a poll as of just in americans believed that nafta had benefited u s workers and only in believed it had benefited the u s economy overall even most republicans in this poll supported the position that the united states should either renegotiate or leave nafta versus continue to be a member in other words any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding nafta while it s not surprising that republicans are siding with big business and against working americans in supporting the tpp it s befuddling that president obama supports it the only hope now is for democratic candidates especially clinton at this point to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is for the most part on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations senate majority leader harry reid minced no words in revealing his position about trade fast track authority i m not only no i m hell no if hillary clinton wants to prove she s a real populist now s her chance to be even more clear
tokyo cnn a week after a japanese court issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in a western prefecture a different court has rejected a petition by residents to delay the reactivation of reactors in the country s southwest kagoshima district court found no irrationalities in new safety standards set out by the government in the wake of the fukushima meltdowns japanese news agency kyodo reported by dismissing resident s demands the court ruled that the sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima could restart the first of two reactors is scheduled to go back online in july the ruling could provide a fillip to the government s plans to bring japanese nuclear reactors back into operation more than four years since the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused the failure at tepco s fukushima plant the original court ruling which affects the takahama plant in fukui prefecture cited safety concerns as the reason for the injunction a court official told cnn japan s nuclear watchdog the nuclear regulation authority had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors and of the kansai electric power company s plant but locals successfully petitioned the court in fukui raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake japan s nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the fukushima disaster in when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant since then the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs japanese prime minister shinzo abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy arguing it is essential to the country s economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports but opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart keith henry managing director of tokyo based asia strategy which advises businesses on japanese public policy issues says the decision will force abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy that was a body blow for abe because it s no longer a political issue it s a legal issue it changes the calculus and the dynamics he said it s now in the courts and the government is powerless to do anything about it read more power company abandons robot stranded inside fukushima plant anti nuclear activists celebrated following the fukui district court s decision in their favor tuesday the nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the fukushima disaster it said in a statement that scientific and professional findings showed that the safety of the reactors was assured but the court ruled that the new safety standards were loose lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant an official said the power company said it would appeal the decision we deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended and cannot accept it at all it said in a statement chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told reporters tuesday that the country s nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the world s strictest safety standards the government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart he said takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations sendai nuclear power plant in kagoshima prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture s governor although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court analyst henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the takahama decision as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives prior to the fukushima disaster about of japan s energy was nuclear generated cnn s junko ogura contributed to this report from tokyo
so now the real trial is underway what does the surviving boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev deserve and why what s he likely to get and why let s start where the penalty phase starts with the prosecution s case prosecutors have listed as they must the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment the killing was heinous cruel and depraved he placed a bomb in a crowd set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately if that s not heinous cruel and depraved what is cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims or at the opposite extreme it reflects a cold callous indifference tsarnaev displayed both cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst the number of dead from the bombing three and injured including dozens maimed also elevate these murders the victims were vulnerable no one more so than year old martin richard for years we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy and those who prey on them as especially culpable the prosecution s emphasis the killings involved substantial planning and premeditation and a betrayal of the united states the very country that gave tsarnaev shelter and citizenship and then there s the selection of the site the boston marathon an iconic event and then there s tsarnaev s lack of remorse opening day the prosecutor s final shot of tsarnaev locked up giving the security camera the finger from his blood scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day the message has been screw you society tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse and don t confuse regret with remorse no doubt tsarnaev regrets his present predicament regrets the negative publicity he s brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape but that s a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he s killed and maimed dzhokhar tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils the defense will insist over and over tamerlan was the source of his younger brother s malicious intent as the prisoners inside washington d c s now defunct lorton central prison once described the street code to me no snitching but if someone dies then the dead guy did everything so the defense will claim that dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be after all he was only biologists teach us our brains don t fully develop until we re thus their argument goes a year old simply can t be the worst of the worst in the u s supreme court struck down the death penalty for those younger than when they killed repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists laurence steinberg and elizabeth scott but in the same article these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an open question whether under real world conditions the decision making of mid adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults and they were talking about year olds to the best of my knowledge science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility think about it when a year old bravely dashes into a burning building risking his life to save children inside we celebrate this heroism we do not nor should we dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not yet fully formed personality if we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults why can t we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst what outcome would i predict in the tsarnaev case confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones hearing offsetting pleas to move on balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits tsarnaev i expect the jury will vote or for death but they must be unanimous for death a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence worse the historical record and headlines in the next day s anti death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim jury chooses life for the marathon bomber even if overwhelmingly the people s representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage one of many why because in the end we would much prefer that or or convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people and yet if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals surely the boston marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst

criminal justice reform is rapidly becoming one of the few bipartisan issues of our time it s about time america has the highest incarceration rate in the world with of the world s population and of its prisoners nearly million americans are in prison over million people or of the country have criminal records most disturbingly nearly of our country s prisoners are african americans who only make up of the general population it s time for policymakers to address this criminal justice crisis head on we must change the dismal status quo we must start by asking a simple question why are so many americans criminals look no further than washington which has spent the past century devising the most complicated and nonsensical criminal code known to man the federal criminal code includes over laws and counting not to mention government regulations for which there are criminal penalties the list of federal crimes is so long so broad and so vague that you and i likely commit three felonies every day unwittingly breaking numerous federal laws as we go about our daily business no wonder america s prison population is out of control americans aren t addicted to crime our politicians are addicted to criminalizing things sadly the criminalization of americans also traps them in poverty according to the pew charitable trusts incarceration leads to reduced wages drop employment nine weeks lost annually and earnings overall annually making matters worse over half of new prisoners are at or below the poverty line and three quarters of former prisoners are sent back to jail within five years of their release the deck is stacked against my generation in particular young adults are of the population yet comprise of the country s arrests young african americans are particularly at risk they re times more likely to be in prison than whites no wonder to year olds have the lowest level of trust of any age group that our justice system treats everyone equally thankfully there is a bipartisan consensus in washington that something needs to be done and fast on the left civil rights groups and their allies in congress have been demanding that the criminal system be fixed for years on the right politicians from paul ryan to rand paul are now recommending the same thing if politicians are serious they should consider three specific areas for reform reduce punishment for nonviolent crimes politicians should consider reducing nonviolent offenses from felonies to misdemeanors and end mandatory sentencing for nonviolent crimes the federal government s unsuccessful war on drugs has led to unfair punishments for nonviolent drug offenders who made youthful mistakes while some policies may have made sense in the s and s they now do more harm than good those involved in the buying and selling of small amounts of drugs shouldn t be subjected to years or decades in prison for their crimes and more generally judges should be free to tailor their rulings to the specific facts and details of the case and the person standing before them rebuild respect between communities and police one size fits all mandates and decrees from washington from drug laws to civil asset forfeiture to no knock warrants create divisions between local law enforcement and the local communities they serve practices policies and programs that create unnecessary distrust and unease should be eliminated it s the same for police militarization which has occurred in large part because washington has supplied local agencies with weapons and tools that are inappropriate for use in local communities letting local communities set their own law enforcement policies will go a long way toward restoring the trust that right now seems almost nonexistent give ex nonviolent offenders a second chance too many reformed convicts return to jail because they face insurmountable barriers that keep them from living a normal life legislators can begin fixing this by encouraging greater record sealing and expungement for youthful non violent offenders thereby giving people who made mistakes a greater chance of finding work and rejoining society reducing licensing barriers and restoring voting rights for those with criminal backgrounds should also be considered this list is only a starting point yet our elected officials could and should quickly and easily take it up in our era of hyperpartisanship we should focus on those few things on which americans agree fixing our country s broken criminal justice system should be at the top of the list
after deliberating for more than hours over parts of seven days listening intently to the testimony of more than witnesses and reviewing more than pieces of evidence the teary eyed men and women of the jury exchanged embraces since late january their work in the massachusetts murder trial of former nfl star aaron hernandez had consumed their lives it was nothing like law order the days were long and tedious now it was over it s been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us lesa strachan told cnn s anderson cooper thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury a day earlier strachan the jury foreperson announced the first degree murder conviction in the shooting death of hernandez s onetime friend odin lloyd strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots you shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times there s no need for that and there s no need to use a gun period before the trial at least one juror rosalie oliver hadn t heard of the year old defendant who has now gone from a million pro football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum security prison but kelly dorsey watches the patriots every sunday during the football season she said so on her jury questionnaire i knew of him as a football player not a person she said it didn t affect her vote to convict she said it didn t matter that he was a football player she said nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder to leave your friend on the ground knowing that he s not there anymore he s either dead or he s going to die that s indifference dorsey said of hernandez he didn t need to pull the trigger that word indifference was used multiple times by members of the jury jon carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that hernandez and two co defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying drinking smoothies hernandez at times left his then month old daughter with the two men that indifference surprised a lot of us carlson said he stressed the fact that hernandez played football for a living didn t influence the jury s decision it doesn t matter how much money you have or how much money you make we re all people and we re all equal and we all deserve the same fair trial and that s what we wanted to make sure we gave him carlson said lloyd was seen june around a m with hernandez and hernandez s friends carlos ortiz and ernest wallace in a rented silver nissan altima later that day a jogger found his body he had been shot six times according to prosecutors wallace and ortiz who were also charged with murder have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately what s next for aaron hernandez rosalie oliver the juror who hadn t heard of hernandez before the trial said that for her the first shot was enough there was no need for the other five she said one shot for me is cruelty oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict who won she asked odin lloyd didn t win his mother didn t bring back her son did mr hernandez win no because he s going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he s years old the worst part for me is how about that little girl that s never going to see her father again what prison life will be like for aaron hernandez oliver recalled making eye contact with hernandez at one point during the months long trial he actually nodded to me one time she said you come in that room every day and you see this person and it s hard to come to that decision at the end because like three months with them it s almost like they re part of you and then all of a sudden now you ve got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go the jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial they conveyed a sense of gravity about their task you see you know law order and all these different tv shows and it s just nothing like that at all it s just very serious carlson said things to know about the jury

warren weinstein who appears to have been the only american citizen held hostage by al qaeda was accidentally killed in a u s drone strike in january but it didn t have to be that way a senior u s official familiar with the handling of the issue told cnn that the u s government made no serious effort to negotiate for the year old development expert s release either directly to al qaeda or through proxies in pakistan another senior u s official told cnn that weinstein s capture by al qaeda made it hard for the united states to negotiate even though proxies such as the pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped a senior pakistani official told cnn that after weinstein was kidnapped the pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant haqqani network and to the pakistani taliban which are both allied to al qaeda to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about weinstein according to the official nothing came of those feelers the senior pakistani official says that during the past year pakistani soldiers who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of north waziristan near the afghan pakistan border where weinstein was believed to be being held went door to door looking for the american nothing came of this search either on thursday the u s government announced that weinstein had been killed in a counterterrorism operation in january which is how the government often describes cia drone strikes according to new america which tracks drone strikes in pakistan cia drone attacks happened in shawal north waziristan on january in which at least four militants were killed also on january in tehsil ladha south waziristan in which at least five militants were killed and on january in datta khel south waziristan in which at least eight militants were killed it is in one of these strikes that weinstein was almost certainly killed lt col jason amerine a planner on the u s army staff is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to u s rep duncan hunter s office which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of american hostages held by al qaeda and the taliban a plan was developed in the pentagon to secure the release of weinstein according to a staff member on hunter s committee that plan was to release haji bashir noorzai a prominent and influential member of the taliban who is in prison in the states on drug trafficking charges in exchange for u s army sgt bowe berghdal who was held by the taliban until last year taliban hostages caitlin coleman a u s citizen and her husband canadian joshua boyle and dr shakil afridi who spied for the cia in pakistan and was being held in a pakistani prison as well as weinstein it s not clear how far this plan of action went amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure hunter a california republican released a statement thursday saying the only government organization seriously developing options to recover weinstein and others in the afghanistan pakistan region was within the pentagon led by war hero jason amerine as an army captain amerine led a small detachment of u s special forces into afghanistan in november in the wake of the september attacks on the united states the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the taliban and to install hamid karzai as the new leader of afghanistan who exactly carried out weinstein s kidnapping from his house years ago in the pakistani megacity of lahore has until now not been clear a senior pakistani counterterrorism official told cnn that members of the islamic movement of uzbekistan or imu kidnapped weinstein at his lahore home on august imu is an uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of pakistan along its border with afghanistan according to the pakistani official the leader of the weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of tahir yuldashev the former imu leader killed in a cia drone strike in the pakistani tribal regions in the initial lead that traced the weinstein kidnapping to the imu came from another high profile kidnapping in pakistan two weeks after weinstein s abduction shahbaz taseer the son of a leading pakistani liberal politician salman taseer who was killed by pakistani militants eight months earlier was kidnapped in lahore on august at the scene of taseer s kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led pakistani officials to focus on the imu group in lahore according to the senior pakistani counterterrorism official the police subsequently arrested three uzbeks and four pakistanis who were part of the imu cell that had carried out the weinstein kidnapping members of the imu cell told pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi conscious among three safe houses in lahore imu members then took weinstein to the federally administered tribal areas in pakistan a semi autonomous region along the border with afghanistan where al qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered there weinstein was given or more likely sold to al qaeda according to the senior pakistani official who was warren weinstein weinstein had spent his life helping others working in the fields of aid and development he held a doctorate in international law and economics from columbia university and spoke more than half a dozen languages after his capture the leader of al qaeda ayman al zawahiri demanded the end of cia drone strikes in pakistan and the release of terrorists held in u s custody in exchange for weinstein s freedom on september weinstein appeared in a video produced by al qaeda s production arm in which he said that the obama administration had shown no interest in my case he then appealed to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu from one jew to another to intervene the obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by isis al qaeda or the taliban the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the u s government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them the cia for instance is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations while the fbi has responsibility for retrieving american hostages often these goals are not in alignment as was clearly the case with weinstein the cia could have exercised more due diligence knowing that weinstein was almost certainly being held in north waziristan there are some solutions for these problems first families should be granted security clearances by the u s government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones right now the u s government won t communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don t have the requisite security clearances should families abuse their clearances they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones which is a strong incentive not to abuse them second president barack obama should appoint a senior level person perhaps working in the white house on the national security council to oversee the work of the cia fbi state department and the joint special operations command which implements hostage rescues all these organizations have key roles to play in getting american hostages home that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and de conflict any potential issues such as the ones that surfaced in the weinstein case third while the u s government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups there is nothing in american policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of u s citizens and this should be encouraged even if there is some quid pro quo involved this is what happened in the case of the american journalist peter theo curtis who was captured by al qaeda s affiliate in syria in but was released last year after the qatari government intervened in his case the qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in syria including the al qaeda affiliate holding curtis and while qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free curtis it s unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys curtis successful release could provide a ray of hope for u s citizen caitlin coleman and her husband canadian joshua boyle who were captured by the taliban in when they were traveling on a trip through afghanistan a senior american official told cnn they are being held by the haqqani network the pakistani government has contacts with the haqqani network and the u s government should ratchet up the pressure on the pakistani government to secure the couple s release in captivity coleman who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage had a child the name of the child is unknown

by some estimates about a third of americans use some form of alternative medicine including homeopathic remedies because they find western medicine inadequate creams such as arnicare for pain relief or liquids such as sidda flower essences for male virility are part of a billion business that has seen explosive growth according to the fda these drugs do not go through the same level of scrutiny as over the counter and prescription drugs but now your over the counter homeopathic remedies might soon face stricter scrutiny from the federal government products such as the homeopathic cold remedies coldese and zicam among others came under fire monday from experts who testified at a food and drug administration hearing monday the two day listening session as the fda calls it is an opportunity for experts and members of the public to help the fda decide how it should regulate these products critics say the agency is not doing enough an analysis of hundreds of published studies from the national health and medical research council in australia found that homeopathic medicine was no more effective than a placebo there is no evidence that they actually work the council claimed and yet it is a multibillion dollar business homeopathy is a medical philosophy that essentially believes your body is the best weapon to fight disease homeopathic medicine is based on the idea that like cures like meaning if something causes a symptom in your body if you take a diluted form it will boost your body s ability to fight it typically these remedies include a plant or a mineral in a tiny amount do homeopathic treatments for adhd work people who represent the industry such as mark land a member of the american association of homeopathic pharmacists argue that the current fda system is a good one and that the products available today are of high quality and label standards are enough critics argued otherwise dr adriane fugh berman testified that most people don t entirely know what homeopathy is and may assume that these products are dietary supplements or are conventional drugs since they are often sold on the same shelves as traditional drugs this practice is innately misleading said fugh berman an associate professor in the department of pharmacology and physiology at georgetown most consumers she said don t know that the fda doesn t routinely review these products for identity purity potency quality or stability prior to marketing opinion alternative healing or quackery while many people believe the drugs are safe in large part because they are highly diluted products such as cold eeze if taken according to the recommendations on the label would be times the recommended dietary allowance rda of zinc for adult females and eight times the recommendation for males according to fugh berman too much zinc can have toxic effects more than people using another homeopathic medicine with zinc zicam reported to the fda that they lost their sense of smell the fda issued a warning to consumers about it in there is a misconception that all homeopathic products are natural according to the fda and therefore safe unfortunately fda has become aware of significant safety issues associated with homeopathic products in recent years according to an email from the agency other issues include a fda warning about hyland s teething tablets they also recalled the tablets that had inconsistent amounts of belladonna larger doses of the substance can be toxic in the fda warned consumers about pleo homeopathic drug products having penicillin or derivatives of penicillin another expert asking for stricter standards with homeopathic medicine janine jagger with the familial mediterranean fever foundation said that there should be stricter label standards that better explained what was actually in the homeopathic product she believed there was a deceptive illusion of treatment when people chose these homeopathic options over pharmaceuticals that have been proven to work a third of americans use alternative medicine a mother and editor of an alternative medicine magazine and website peggy o mara testified that homeopathic medicine has helped her family over the years as a writer and editor of health publications she said she has seen a growing interest in this kind of medicine and she believes it is is well placed she believes people have more trust that consumers do their research before purchasing the product as she does she wishes doctors were better versed in this kind of medicine and believes others want safe effective and easily accessible products that are nontoxic alternatives to help people feel better the public hearing will continue tuesday the fda could make decisions about these labeling and regulation standards some time this year
we belong to different generations and political parties we live in different states and under different circumstances one of us is a college student born into a political family while the other is a former congressman from south carolina and father of five children one of us served on the selection committee for the john f kennedy profile in courage award the other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change we share an unwavering belief that the united states must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity growth and progress we believe that president kennedy s courageous leadership in space exploration holds lessons that can help guide us forward in president kennedy speaking at rice university described the space program that he had first announced when he asked the congress to support his ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade opening his speech kennedy stated simply the effect of man s scientific pursuit the greater our knowledge increases the greater our ignorance unfolds this curious paradox holds true today our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable others choose to dispute the science deny the evidence and avoid the question of how to solve the problem but climate change is only scary if we choose to sit wait and do nothing about it president kennedy encountered the same dilemma it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest to wait but this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them we need not be frightened today climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of american triumph and human progress it is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the american political heroes of earlier times who left the world a better place for us courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things we believe that america will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on earth from travel in space kennedy told the crowd at rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish we choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard he said something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity and it would push us toward greatness there will always be reasons for inaction many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the great recession they will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered progress on climate change will require courage some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet we can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left by adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners interest to join us meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger as americans we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it we believe just as president kennedy did that only if america leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise we call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again
a sweat smothered man in a wide brimmed hat knee high leather boots and a khaki uniform machetes his way through lush jungle foliage as thick tangles of vine fall beneath his blade he pushes into a clearing then suddenly staggers back the fanged mouth of a primordial stone beast gapes toward him before him rise the crumbled ruins of an enormous portal of rock black with age but with a colossal grandeur not yet lost a fine example of what archaeologists call a zoomorphic portal or more popularly a monster mouth gate what was once the gateway to an ancient mayan city built circa ad and mysteriously abandoned four centuries later stands before him he has found the lost city of lagunita now that the planet has been mapped circumnavigated measured and tagged in every way imaginable the age of explorers discovering new worlds seems a quaint memory but there are still adventurers exploring forgotten corners of the globe and some find astonishing things one such explorer part indiana jones part magellan is slovenian archaeologist ivan šprajc the sprightly šprajc wears the weathered face of a man who has spent much of his years beneath a hot sun at excavations or hacking his way through dense jungle he has been the first to see ancient pyramids meters high that he spotted in aerial photographs from his office among the baroque mitteleuropean cobbled streets of ljubljana slovenia some kilometers away but in terms of the thrill of discovery it doesn t get any better than his encounter with lagunita s monster portal what does it feel like to find a lost city it s a victory says šprajc especially when the efforts are long on several occasions we ve had two three weeks of just cutting through the bush to get to some location without knowing what we would find when we get to the site it feels like a big victory like we ve done it if it had been easy then other people would have done it already since he and his team have discovered more than ancient mayan cities in the jungles of mexico few of which the modern world had known before but how can an entire city which once may have been home to tens of thousands simply vanish šprajc explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because it s so inaccessible it s so hard to get there it s a biosphere a protected natural area that has never been densely populated since the collapse of the classical mayans for the past thousand years or so when a primal jungle is allowed to grow rampant for centuries it can indeed swallow entire cities but just why so many settlements were simply abandoned long before the arrival of the spanish conquistadors remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer ninety nine percent of settlements in the central and southern lowlands of the yucatan peninsula were abandoned in a matter of years by ad practically everything was abandoned that was the situation when the spaniards came but not so in the northern section of the peninsula and the guatemala highlands where there was no rupture until the arrival of the spaniards so what happened in that enormous area that led to this mass evacuation nobody knows the exact sequence of events but it was definitely a combination of droughts climate change and overpopulation but other things must have come as consequences devastating raids and wars among the mayan states which resembled the constantly battling ancient greek city states in this late classical period wars intensified with devastating consequences for if one city state was destroyed or overcome it had a ripple effect on trade networks it was a sort of globalized mayan world to learn more would require extensive time consuming surveys of each site which is a different sort of fieldwork than šprajc likes to practice his team will map what appears to be the core of a settlement but there simply isn t time or manpower to map it all so hundreds of structures are left for others to survey and excavate the adrenaline of the treasure hunt is what drives šprajc the eureka moment when he finds the buried treasure he is not in the least proprietary about what he discovers preferring to let other research teams dive in to the sites he has found to slowly excavate catalogue and analyze what he finds this extensive mapping is not our job we are taking the first step into an unknown area šprajc is a throwback to the great th century explorers a dying breed as the world becomes smaller and science bleaches out its mysteries but in the heat of the jungle science can only get you so far intrepid spirit calloused palms sweat blood and patience are more important than gadgetry as šprajc likes to say we can survive without computers but not without machetes noah charney is a professor of art history and best selling author he teaches a guardian masterclass called how to write about art
melbourne australia cnn a man stands on a beach in a distant land waves lap his ankles he wades through the gentle dawn light arms outstretched his head held high he is fully dressed not a tourist but a freedom fighter a photograph of this man beamed around the world becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty it is the man is peter greste if you thought the man might have been an anzac on the shores of gallipoli such is the power of persuasion it s easy to lead a horse to water when in the centenary year of the gallipoli campaign our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance the sum total of television programming beer advertising political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of australia s involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation young white man plus distant beach equals sacrifice there is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead last weekend i planted gallipoli rosemary in my backyard part of the proceeds go to the avenues of honour a national project to preserve and restore australia s living memorials more objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game to widen the scope of historical tribute and also recall the words and deeds of the australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive but the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped australia asunder even at the time the great war itself was divisive a historical reality belied by today s bland blanket coverage of the anzac spirit australia s participation in the war was contested from the outset on august veteran political campaigner vida goldstein wrote in her woman voter newspaper it is a fearful reflection on years of christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict as she had done years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words the time has come for women to show that they as givers of life refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter australian and new zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate the vote the enfranchised women of australia are political units in the british empire goldstein argued and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts goldstein s early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace under the newly legislated war precautions act the woman voter suffered censorship leading goldstein and her women s peace army to fight on multiple fronts we are fighting for civil liberty and against military despotism around the nation trade unionists opposed to the capitalist war joined the movement australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the allied forces less than of eligible men signed up to fight for king and country as the carnage at gallipoli brought home the realities of war recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread general strikes halted industry as workers reacted to the food shortages unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of the working man s paradise with enlistments falling away in prime minister billy hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the unlawful associations act groups that voiced opposition to the war like the international workers of the world were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material likely to cause disaffection or alarm when waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike the war precautions act was invoked to send them back to work in september the sydney twelve were arrested and tried for treason fifteen years for words was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment the conscription referendums of october and december became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war or the federal government s domestic policies there were diverse reasons for that opposition including the anti british sentiments of irish catholic australians in melbourne the meeting place for such public debate was yarra bank a pocket of land nestled between what today is birrarung marr and the rod laver arena anti conscription demonstrations saw up to people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown yarra river most protest meetings were peaceful but one became infamously violent riotous scenes at yarra bank headlines around the nation proclaimed when a demonstration organized by the women s peace army in the week before the referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers both conscription referendums ultimately failed the australian dictionary of biography contains profiles of anti conscriptionists many of whom went to jail including vida goldstein s compatriots adela pankhurst and jennie baines baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at yarra bank in she is reputedly the first australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike other protesters were deported as historian janet butler reminds us it does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide the enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of gallipoli manifested not only in the shattered anzacs whose families bore the burden of care but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped australia s social and political relations in the th century lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much but are still accorded little recognition perhaps by the th anniversary of the gallipoli campaign when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives we will come to associate riverbanks as well as beaches with the potent ebb and flow of freedom copyright the conversation

it wasn t until her s that fethiye cetin discovered her armenian ancestry her grandmother years old at the time told cetin that her real name was heranus like many other survivors of heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden many feared a repeat of the horrors they witnessed and barely escaped in a crowded reception before a memorial concert in istanbul this week people rushed to greet fethiye cetin a strong soft spoken woman now in her s cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented armenian turkish journalist hrant dink dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between turks and armenians who was tried for insulting turkishness he was assassinated in the shocking discovery of her true heritage would change cetin s life she tells heranus story in an evocative memoir titled my grandmother heranus and her family were among a massive stream of women and children being forcibly marched by ottoman soldiers not knowing where they were going or why they were torn away from their male relatives echoing throughout the procession were morbid whispers that the men and teenage boys had all been killed heranus was at the time an officer spotted her and her brother and wanted to take them away her mother protested but she was told by others the children are dying one by one no one will make it out alive from this march if you give them their lives will be saved heranus and her brother were scooped up onto the officer s horse and taken to a garden packed with other children and fed the first warm meal they had had in days but soon reality set in and heranus

impunity paved a path to holocaust and genocides in rwanda cambodia and darfur the survivors of and witnesses remember massacres bloodied rivers concentration camps rape and death marches into the syrian desert the republic of turkey has always rejected the term genocide rather the ottoman empire s committee of union and progress believed armenian nationalists to be collaborating with the russian army which was at war with the ottoman empire to prevent this alliance and stop violence against civilians the committee undertook a policy of relocation to move armenian populations residing in or near the war zone to southern provinces turkey argues that wartime conditions famine and internal conflicts led to the death of millions of ottomans including armenian subjects but it s only in the last decade that public dialogue in turkey began we just started breaking the silence recently cetin said people were quiet for years in this country turkish leaders have recently taken a more reconciliatory tone turkish president recep tayyip erdogan offered turkey s condolences last year to the descendants of the armenians who lost their lives he called for the establishment of a joint historical commission in order to study the events of but pope francis use of the word genocide and the european parliament s resolution last week angered turkish leaders the ministry of foreign affairs called the resolution selective and one sided claiming it repeated anti turkish clichés erdogan deemed it a hostile campaign against turkey this week turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu

old wounds a century on cetin says the dynamism surrounding the th anniversary excites her bringing together artists musicians scholars and intellectuals as well as turkey s citizens of all ethnicities and armenians from across the world if the government were to acknowledge as a genocide it would speed up the reconciliation and healing process she says but if it does not face genocide then it does not matter society coming face to face with it is more important still cetin remains hopeful that turkey will accept its moral obligation towards history and its people as an armenian turk cetin has helped others retrace their roots and look for long lost answers but for many the emotional journey remains unfulfilled as long as turkey denies the cause of their pain

we want our killers to be kind to walk into court and show remorse tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives or they were temporarily insane even though those things may not be true too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder well aaron hernandez the former new england patriots tight end and now convicted murderer made none of those excuses he walked into court with an air of bravado his head held high like the million nfl superstar he was just a couple of years ago several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee shayanna jenkins during the trial and we didn t like his swagger hernandez didn t offer a plausible alibi he didn t look ashamed or remorseful he never wept his own attorney james sultan admitted that hernandez witnessed the killing of odin lloyd committed by somebody he knew but said his client did not commit the crime even before the guilty verdict came down wednesday for many at least those covering the trial audacity seemed to be the defendant s biggest crime the arrogance of aaron hernandez a new yorker headline accused i don t get it what does it matter that hernandez was arrogant in court or walked with too much swagger or even smiled at his girl like it or not that is who he is the evidence is what matters and for once this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision guilty of first degree murder in the slaying of odin lloyd hernandez was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition it was the right decision still it s hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both lloyd and now hernandez who were once friends football was the best thing hernandez ever had especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in hernandez was after that his life got complicated at hernandez went off to the university of florida and seemed headed for greatness there he won the john mackey award as the nation s best tight end and led the team in receiving during its bowl championship series win but off the field his life was to beginning to unravel trouble started bar fights reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests he was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a gainesville florida nightclub by the time he was drafted in by the new england patriots hernandez had already been labeled a troubled player but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case they did everything right this time hours after hernandez was charged with murder he was let go from the team and his coaches didn t spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent family loving guy as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble this time justice worked there s no reason to second guess what went wrong to ask how could a star nfler be a murderer the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league where despite the ugly headlines the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding law abiding citizens and patriots bashers me included would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others even those closest to us not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job there was no way to predict hernandez would end up a murderer he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world but he still went wrong hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom according to a law enforcement source close to the case hernandez told officers escorting him hey man i m going to miss you guys i don t need any luck any more he gave you the impression it s kinda like no big deal it is what it is
fifty years ago in frankfurt german prosecutors tried former nazi ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in germany at the time fritz bauer the german jewish attorney general of hessen expressed the simple hope that sooner or later one of the accused would step forward and say what took place it was horrific i m sorry then the entire world would exhale as would all the survivors of those killed at auschwitz and the air would be cleared sadly bauer observed it has not been uttered nor will it be the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of holocaust trials john demjanjuk whose conviction by a munich court in established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of oskar gröning remained defiantly silent during his month trial never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse over the years some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations but have insisted that they played no role those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb over the years an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that ss men had engaged in extermination out of duress the results were astonishing investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a german officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide not one these evasions and lies were often effective as many german trials of holocaust perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal and even when a trial ended in a conviction what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide fritz bauer can now exhale on april on the opening day of his trial in lüneburg where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of jews during his service at auschwitz the year old gröning faced the court and acknowledged it is beyond question that i am morally complicit this moral guilt i acknowledge here before the victims with regret and humility if nothing else comes from the trial that statement alone justifies the undertaking of course in acknowledging his moral complicity gröning fell short of confessing legal guilt indeed for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law arguing in an interview with der spiegel in that he had been no more than a cog in the gears at auschwitz gröning was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to berlin in performing this task gröning insists that he never engaged in cruel murderous or sadistic acts a claim that we can probably accept as true but does this relieve him of criminal liability for decades german courts held that mere service as a concentration camp in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing constituted no crime under german law in the demjanjuk conviction changed that in convicting demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of jews at the sobibor death camp the munich court concluded that death camp guards regardless of how they had conducted themselves had to be accessories to murder because that was their job it was a crucial breakthrough because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process when it comes to factory like genocide guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness guilt follows function convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the munich court by this standard gröning s truthful claim that he was no more than a cog constitutes an admission of guilt this does not mean that gröning deserves the same measure of punishment as an ss sadist in fact it s not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction but without the court s conviction gröning s important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete the significance of gröning s trial can be measured in one final way many have observed that it coincides with the th anniversary of the end of world war ii but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort april marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of armenians by the ottomans during world war i an event many have described as genocide and yet the turkish nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago with that in mind gröning s trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning

saturday s deadly earthquake in nepal was the big one experts were waiting for based on the region s history earthquakes are a fact of life in the south asian country with tremors of magnitude or occurring several times each year geologist and science journalist kate ravilious said with the last major earthquake in the concern was not if but when the next great earthquake would hit said ravilious author of the article kathmandu s earthquake nightmare in a landlocked country like nepal where infrastructure is fragile to begin with the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be much more serious ravilious told cnn those fears were realized when a magnitude earthquake centered less than miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal toppling homes historic buildings and leaving more dead authorities said this event while large and tragic is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from tibet almost to caspian sea is an area of major collision between continental plates said geological engineer nicholas sitar with the university of california berkeley s department of civil and environmental engineering what s different this time from is the size and density of kathmandu which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes the population has exploded in several decades u s geological survey spokesman gavin hayes told cnn when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that isn t equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size that s when you see the scale of disaster we re seeing now the big unknown is what happens next now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed ravilious said how will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country whose single international airport is closed how will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed if and when landslides start how will mountainside villages in the himalayan range fare and will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts the worry now is to get nepal up and running again on feet ravilious said the monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we don t sort things out before then an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault according to the u s geological survey stresses in the earth s outer layer push the sides of the fault together releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth s crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake nepal is located on a major plate boundary between india and eurasia where collisions have been in progress for about million years those collisions are responsible for the construction of the himalayas which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world said chris goldfinger director of oregon state university s active tectonics and seafloor mapping laboratory india is moving northward into eurasia at a rate of about millimeters a year with earthquakes of a magnitude from to occurring on average in the himalaya every to years said marin k clark associate professor of geological sciences with the university of michigan s department of earth and environmental sciences the last major earthquake to affect this part of the himalayas was in the s and kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday s quake in a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking clark said the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard clark compared the circumstances to the earthquake in sichuan province china the magnitude earthquake generated more landslides many of which blocked roads slowing response and recovery efforts the landslides also blocked river valleys which created significant flood hazard we might anticipate a similar situation for nepal

washington cnn in al qaeda took warren weinstein hostage then about a year later his family paid money to his captors said a pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers it did not lead to the american aid worker s release and he was inadvertently killed in an anti terror strike in january the white house announced thursday after the transfer of funds in the captors who never referred to themselves as al qaeda but instead as afghans began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for weinstein most prominently dr aafia siddiqui of pakistan the source said she has been described as the poster girl for islamic jihad and is serving an year sentence in the united states the militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the pakistani province of waziristan along the afghan border the source said the men on the other end of the phone spoke pashto with an accent typical for the border region and they were professional in their dealings said the source who noticed a marked change after the money was paid the people who had originally talked to the source about weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone the militants also connected themselves with other terror events after isis beheaded american james foley weinstein s afghan captors told the source that the iraqis were asking for the american and that they were preparing an orange suit for him a reference to the suits that victims have worn when isis militants murdered them when the taliban released u s army sgt bowe bergdahl a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of bergdahl s kidnappers they had said at one point that if they did kill weinstein they d announce it in a big way because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate the captors had called the source daily since sometime in and the last time the source spoke with them in early april they said that weinstein was still alive in spite of a request for proof of life the militants didn t give one after that the calls stopped the source never had a number for the militants they had always been the ones who called the source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors leaving the disclosure to weinstein s family could weinstein have been saved weinstein s family in maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to congress weinstein s wife elaine and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one s plight especially media attention would make weinstein a government contractor working with usaid in pakistan a more valuable hostage to his al qaeda captors but the family switched course and went to their representatives in congress in late after a video of weinstein frail and apparently in declining health surfaced in which he said he felt totally abandoned and forgotten by his country will the drone debate return more than a year later that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the weinsteins and the maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed weinstein s case with the obama administration as well as pakistan the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one according to one of those lawmakers and a senate aide we don t get choked up too often at work algene sajery said as she held back tears but this is really hard sajery is a foreign policy adviser to sen ben cardin d maryland who worked closely on the case after the white house announced that weinstein had been accidentally killed in a january u s drone strike the aide s first call was to weinstein s daughters myself and my colleague worked really closely with them talked to them all the time they re just such good people sajery said of the family there s a personal connection there cardin and his staff had tracked the weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in august but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case cardin s staff joined forces with rep john delaney the weinsteins congressman and began setting up meetings for the family cardin s staff set up meetings for the senator and weinstein s family with everyone from the u s special representative to afghanistan and pakistan to the pakistani ambassador in washington cardin and sen barbara mikulski d maryland wrote to president barack obama calling on the u s to beef up efforts to secure weinstein s release and dedicate more resources to the cause and the staff and lawmakers helped the weinsteins weave through the network of agencies from the fbi to the state department and the white house working to bring weinstein home we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated delaney told cnn on thursday the government is a bureaucracy and you have to make sure that it s working but for the weinsteins and the families of other american hostages held by terror groups abroad the government hasn t always worked well enough a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on capitol hill who worked to help them al qaeda hostage warren weinstein killed unfortunately the assistance we received from other elements of the u s government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years elaine weinstein said in a statement thursday we hope that my husband s death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the u s government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families it s a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of american hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient u s government efforts to bring their loved ones home delaney was saddened disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring warren home he said in a statement thursday and in an interview with cnn later in the day he strayed away from blaming the obama administration or people in various u s agencies instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system the weinstein family s frustration with that system boiled over last summer when bergdahl the u s army sergeant was released by a taliban affiliated group in exchange for five guantanamo bay prisoners the u s policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception it s one of those things where it s both there s some hope but at the same time it caused them some great frustration delaney recalled saying the family asked why not warren but as the state department called the bergdahl exchange a unique situation the weinsteins hopes were dashed that s when they asked us to really step up our efforts sajery said that s when they decided to really go public delaney introduced a resolution calling on the obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring weinstein home and make his return and that of other u s hostages abroad a top priority mikulski cardin and sens dick durbin and mark kirk of illinois pushed a similar resolution in the senate and the weinsteins took to the airwaves with alisa weinstein appearing on cnn s ac to make a public appeal for her father s release and for the u s government to do more to secure his freedom my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt bergdahl as are all of the americans who are being held abroad she said on cnn last june you cannot distinguish between these hostages they can t just pick and choose decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there white house press secretary josh earnest on thursday said that significant resources were dedicated to try to free weinstein and that as painful as it is the u s policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more americans at risk and state department acting spokeswoman marie harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the weinsteins throughout the process while the u s policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place the state department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of american hostages held by terrorists abroad she said the white house announced the review last fall which obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped americans abroad speaking at the office of the director of national intelligence on friday obama reiterated that the white house will review what happened we all bleed when we lose an american life he said we all grieve when any innocent life is taken we don t take this work lightly obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified while only their failures become public the world doesn t always see your successes the threats you prevent or the terrorist attacks you thwart or the lives that you save obama said it can be frustrating sometimes but that s part of the function of our democracy but i know what you do but delaney the weinsteins congressman is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing american hostages held abroad delaney on thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the u s find american hostages an effort he s been pushing in recent months the tragedy of weinstein s death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms i think that every single american wants any american held hostage returned delaney said there s tremendous support to do more on friday elaine weinstein said in a statement that the family has been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world we appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the warren we loved so much as well as those who did not the statement said our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals cnn s sophia saifi reported from islamabad pakistan jeremy diamond reported and wrote from washington saima mohsin reported from bangkok cnn s ben brumfield

istanbul turkey cnn sitting on a sunny bench in istanbul s gezi park fadime gurgen dismisses the controversy surrounding the th anniversary friday of the massacre of armenians under the ottoman empire with a wave of her hand gurgen a year old cleaner says her family has had close friendships with armenians going back generations there is no such thing as genocide she says other people are trying to create hostility between us most turks agree with gurgen ninety one percent of turks do not believe that the events of when according to armenians million ethnic armenians were systematically killed in the final years of the ottoman empire were genocide according to a recent poll it s a sentiment shared by the turkish government which denies that a genocide took place maintaining that hundreds of thousands of turkish muslims and armenian christians died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of world war i turkey also disputes armenia s count of the numbers killed putting it at it s a heavily disputed position the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the armenian government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community armenian prime minister hovik abrahamyan said friday in statement that turkey s ottoman rulers had planned and carried out a monstrous crime in the years of world war i and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide many armenians living in turkey still feel treated as second class citizens however many have hope that turkey s younger generation is more willing to accept that a genocide occurred than their parents students are much much more liberal says diana van whose grandparents escaped the mass killings van is a member of the delegation for the armenian genocide commemoration and is writing her masters thesis on the issue at ankara university they have access to alternative information written in english which is not taught in school in turkey with more access to books to alternative information and with a larger democratization process turkey will be able to face its history a century after her armenian ancestors escaped death in eastern turkey van says she is frustrated that turkey is unwilling to accept what happened your identity is denied by turkey she says they do not want to face this past in turkey the word armenian is still used as a curse whenever you want to hurt somebody you say you are like an armenian van says an admission of genocide by turkey would largely be symbolic while her grandparents lost their land she has returned to their villages and she recognizes that trying to reclaim it would be impossible i do not believe that this is going to happen she says of the territorial claims made by many armenians one hundred years have passed i went to my ancestors land and i saw those armenian lands full of kurdish people who have five to children per family and i saw that it s not anatolia it s not my homeland that i had in my imagination a growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide germany looks set to join the european parliament france austria canada and some other countries in labeling the atrocity a genocide two weeks ago the pope referred to mass killings as the first genocide of the th century a move that infuriated turkish president recep tayyip erdogan who called the claim nonsense and recalled his ambassador to the vatican some notable countries do not recognize the killings as genocide including the uk and israel and earlier this week u s president barack obama wary of damaging relations with turkey amid growing unrest in the middle east did not use the word genocide there are several reasons why turkey maintains its position on the issue turks say that to most people there the term genocide is associated with nazis not the beloved founders of modern turkey last year the turkish government expressed condolences to armenians and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in central and eastern anatolia in the waning years of the ottoman empire but the government called it a necessary deportation during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to world war i when many armenian radicals were threatening to side with russia turkey says that there was never a deliberate ethnically driven effort to exterminate the armenian population it was a wartime precaution like the u s relocated the japanese population during world war ii says dr kamer kasim dean of abant izzet baysal university kasim dismisses the drive for the genocide label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the armenian diaspora politics and timing is another issue at a time when president erdogan is in full campaign mode ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections he is attempting to assuage concerns about unemployment and slowed growth by drumming up nationalist fervor with promises of a new turkey akin to the glory days of the ottoman empire it s hardly the time to label the country s founders as murderers that wouldn t play well with turks many of whom have gone through years of schooling that instilled in them a fierce pride in their past in the same way that american schools often whitewashed the history of u s settlers and their relations with native americans turkish schools have long taken an airbrush to the young turks the movement which began in was comprised of the army officers who were in power as the country transitioned from the hands of spoiled sultans to mustafa kemal atatürk the much adored leader who came to power in and is credited with founding the modern turkish state the taboo surrounding the use of the word genocide began to crack about a decade ago when two of turkey s best selling international authors orhan pamuk and elif safak joined other intellectuals in raising the issue of whether the country s forefathers had committed genocide pamuk and safak were met with crushing resistance they were harangued in the court of public opinion and tried in real life court on charges of insulting turkishness since turkish schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide calling the events of a genocide would undermine the very narratives the turks hold most dear says burcu gultekin punsmann a senior analyst at ankara policy center who has studied turkish armenian relations for a decade she says the country simply isn t ready to dismantle the foundation it was built on or stain the legacy of its founders turkey is still too young and too insecure to rewrite its history and question the events unfolding at the establishment of the republic punsmann says but in a statement issued to mark the anniversary of the killings president erdogan urged dialogue saying as descendants of two ancient peoples who a hundred years ago shared the same destiny whether in joy or in sorrow our common responsibility and calling today is to heal century old wounds and re establish our human ties once again turkey will not remain indifferent to this responsibility and will continue to do its utmost for friendship and peace but there are other issues including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the turkish government in descendants of exiled armenians filed suit in a u s court against two german banks for restitution of assets based on evidence that ottoman ministries required that seized armenian assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in germany one year old armenian woman living in the u s claims to have land deeds proving that her parents owned land that now houses an airport her case is winding its way through the turkish court system but her lawyer ali elbeyoglu says the genocide debate has no effect we have deeds so we are following the law and politics don t matter others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between turkey and armenia like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors aybars gorgulu a foreign policy expert at tesev one of turkey s leading think tanks argues that it is armenia not turkey which suffers most from the tensions surrounding the issue and he says it isn t in armenia s best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he doesn t believe will ever come there s no diplomatic relations between the countries and that plays into why turks think there s a crazy diaspora obsessed with genocide but that s not true gorgulu says the best thing for armenia would be to enter into dialogue with turkey normalize relations and open the border meanwhile the publicity surrounding the anniversary on friday has prompted debate amongst turks of all ages on sunday there will be a conference at bogazici university on the atrocity one of few in turkey that openly uses the term genocide nisan gul goker a year old art management student with bright pink lipstick is one of the few turks who believes that her country should change course they keep referring to this as an armenian incident in quotations and can t call it genocide she says boarding the metro to her classes at aydin university we should be ashamed of this and accept it

for years when i d tell new friends i was half armenian a puzzled look would cross their faces before they d ask something like do you have a country or when there was a spark of recognition they d chortle ah you re the people with the last names all ending in ian in fact one of our most famous armenians cher was better known for her oscar winning portrayals of italians and had dropped her own identifying surname the decimation of our people too was reduced to a footnote if we were lucky in tomes about world war i when more than one million armenians were killed during the last days of the ottoman empire most of the time though the coverage was about how armenians and turks hate each other like cats and dogs that the turks continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred saying the armenians had hatched a rebellion and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths even adolf hitler had brushed us aside uttering just before invading poland in september who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the armenians according to the former bureau chief of the associated press in berlin louis lochner apparently he hadn t the anticipated the kardashian juggernaut as kim kardashian sister khloe and their two cousins recently toured armenia on the eve of the th anniversary of the mass killings which is marked on april they spotlighted a humanitarian crime that pope francis recently called the first genocide of the th century suddenly the poor landlocked country of armenia was trending standing in front of the statute of mother armenia kim seemed to seize the label herself and the adoring crowds appeared to agree on another stop of her tour she dressed in a red jumpsuit and placed tulips at the slate gray armenian genocide memorial complex bringing new color to an issue and to a people who usually pay tribute to their dead relatives every year in their best funereal black after the kardashian trip to armenia my elderly mother anahid called me nearly breathless with pride have you seen the genocide is all over the news that famous lady kim kardashian has done it my mother s own father stepan miskjian with his own ian surname had narrowly survived the killings he told of how an entire caravan of thousands was killed in what s now eastern syria and that he only escaped by waiting until night and crawling out on his hands and knees past the ring of guards and then crossing the desert for six days with only enough water to fill two cups when the kardashians first rose to fame many armenians cringed over their potboiler storyline their million dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers multiple divorces and a clothing line at sears through their fame though people began to learn about armenians even people outside los angeles where the armenian population is as thick as the kardashian hair that americans may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest keeping up with the kardashian plotline was a source of discomfort for the community but every once in a while kim kardashian would tweet something about the issue and slowly the community began to warm to her meanwhile many armenians continued to brainstorm about how to convince turkey to acknowledge the truth about what happened and how to persuade the president barack obama to label the killings genocide as he promised when first campaigning for the highest office we cheered and forwarded emails every time a rumor surfaced that steven spielberg was going to take one of our family stories to the big screen give us our own schindler s list and hoped maybe now the world would be forced to listen and we would deflate when it wouldn t come to fruition and every april the day in when ottoman turks began rounding up the community s intellectual leaders we mobilized and we will do so again this year holding candlelight vigils concerts and protest marches while waving the armenian flag even though many of us have never been to the country ourselves we also press forward on the academic front holding conferences on the latest research around the world exulting in the discovery of yet another bit of information that would surely make the world reckon that would counter turkey s steadfast pressure on the united states to not acknowledge the atrocities and still disappointingly early reports surfaced yet once more as in years before that obama has decided again on this year s anniversary not to use the g word despite all the setbacks the armenians will continue to speak out and hopefully find some hallowed ground too to stand with turks to heal after all we ve learned an increased dialogue can come from the most surprising places this year it took a reality star famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump to catapult it to the top of the news once again like it was on december when headlines like million armenians killed or in exile splashed across the new york times and other international media after a century of trying to raise awareness what we needed all along was a television and internet persona to join us especially one who shares everything on every platform to shed light on a crime that occurred back when telegrams were the speedy form of communication and photographic plates of the killings had to be smuggled out in a belt rather than blasted instantaneously with a tweet the queen of the selfies has finally used her attention for good and hopefully it won t be as short lived as some of her other memes that s a crusade i can follow in any medium
